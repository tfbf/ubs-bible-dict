Adam is barely out of the garden of Eden when we read that Jubal was “the ancestor of all musicians who play the harp and the flute,” and that Tubal Cain “made all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 4:21</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 4:22</span>; Good News Translation [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>]).","The Bible mentions at least five hundred distinct objects manufactured by humans, and these can present a special challenge to the translator. While there is much that is common to all human experience, and basic material needs remain fairly constant, a number of factors can make it difficult to find the proper equivalent when translating a word for a particular material object. For example, raw materials vary widely, physical conditions may dictate different solutions to a common problem, and technology can differ greatly from one region to another and from one era to another.","The end result is that one present-day culture may not have a word for an object that was common in the lands of the Bible three thousand years ago, while another culture may have ten words for varieties of the same object. In the first case the translator needs to find a way to help the reader understand the meaning and significance of an unknown object; in the second case he or she will probably have to determine which variation of a known item is intended by the Scriptures.","Modern counterparts of ancient things may have changed so much that to use the modern word is to mislead the reader. It is important not to introduce anachronisms into the translation. For example, when rendering the writing implement “pen,” the translator should not choose a word that in normal speech indicates a ballpoint pen. In cases where no word exists in a language for an equivalent object, there are several options. It may be possible to borrow a word from a regional or trade language. Another alternative is to expand the translation somewhat to describe the object or its function. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 7:7</span> the Hebrew text refers to a man as standing “... beside a wall built with a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand” (so Revised Standard Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>]), but the Contemporary English Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>) expands this to “... beside a wall and holding a string with a weight tied to the end of it. The string and weight had been used to measure the straightness of the wall.” An option open to Bible editions with annotations is to describe an object and its use in a footnote. Finally, it may be possible to include a glossary at the end of a Bible edition and explain difficult terms there.","In some cases, while a specific physical object is mentioned in the text, it is not essential to the understanding of the text. For example, the Hebrew expression “you will possess his gates” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:60</span>) may be difficult in some cultures where walled cities with gates are unknown. However, there will be no loss of meaning if we render the clause as “you will capture his city.” This kind of substitute is frequently possible when objects are used figuratively. The translator must be careful, however, not to eliminate the object too quickly but to check if some meaning or significance would be lost if it is replaced through rewording.","It can come as a surprise to find how often physical objects are used in a figurative or metaphorical sense in the Bible. The Greek word for “yoke,” for example, appears five times in the New Testament, always figuratively. Translators must take care to ensure that a literal rendering of the material object will retain the same figurative sense in the receptor language. Where the figurative meaning would be obscured, it may be better not to mention the physical object and simply render the figurative meaning. For example, the statement of the angel to Mary in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 2:35</span> that “a sword will pierce your soul” (New Jerusalem Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>]) may be impossible in some languages. Since the focus is not on the physical object “sword,” a translator may keep the meaning with “you will experience anguish” or find a similar idiom as the New English Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>) has done: “you ... shall be pierced to the heart.”","This book is not intended to be a lexicon on the material culture of the Bible. For this you may use books like those mentioned in the Bibliography. The focus here is the translation task and we have endeavored to keep the needs of the Bible translator in view. For this reason there will normally not be a discussion of how a particular object came into being or the stages through which it developed before its appearance in Scripture. Similarly, the dimensions of material objects are given only with a degree of precision that can help the translator to choose between different options in his or her own culture."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Illustrations</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Most of the items discussed in this Handbook are accompanied by one or more illustrations. While it is recognized that the details of construction of many of the items changed or evolved over the course of the centuries covered by the Bible, it is not the purpose of this Handbook to document that evolution. Illustrations are included here to aid the translator to find the right word or phrase when translating specific Bible verses. In almost no case will the small changes in construction affect the choice of words to be used in a translation. Only where it is thought that this might be the case are different illustrations given showing those changes. Even in such cases, the differences between, for example, early Old Testament times and New Testament times are usually explained only in the written description of the item. Archaeology is constantly uncovering physical objects that throw new light on the material culture of the ancient world. Some of these discoveries change the accepted wisdom about how objects were constructed and used or when they made their first appearance in history. While the author has attempted to represent the current position among scholars, it is to be expected that some of the information will be outdated even before it is printed. It is hoped that the differences will have little adverse effect on the quality of translations.","Some of the illustrations are photographs of objects uncovered in archaeological excavations.

In this Handbook we have sometimes given those original measurements and then converted them to their modern equivalents. A difficulty arises when converting the cubit, since varying lengths for the cubit were used at different times or in different contexts. While this inconsistency may influence the translation of the actual dimensions listed in Scripture, it will rarely affect the translation of the name of a material object. For that reason this Handbook consistently uses an approximate length for the cubit of fifty centimeters or twenty inches."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>References</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["With each entry appears a list of transliterated Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, or Latin words that represent the object being discussed.

The implement served as a kind of hoe for loosening the soil or like an adze for shaping wood (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.9.3 Axe, adze&lt;REALIA:1.1.9.3&gt;</a>).","“Sickle” (<em>machareshah</em>): Here again <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has followed the Septuagint in translating “sickle” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.6 Sickle&lt;REALIA:1.1.6&gt;</a>).

The rod in the hand of the shepherd or traveler could serve multiple purposes. Sometimes it simply helped to maintain balance while walking over rough ground. It could also be wielded as an offensive or defensive weapon. On offense, it is probably best rendered “club” (see also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">2.7 Club, war club, mace, shattering weapon&lt;REALIA:2.7&gt;</a>). The Hebrew words are similar in meaning, and in several places they are used in poetic parallelism (<em>mateh</em> and <em>shevet</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 27:32</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:5</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:15</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:24</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 28:27</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:31; Isa 30:32</span>).","Some cultures will have a special word for a staff carried by a shepherd or someone who herds other animals. In other contexts the best rendering will be something like “walking stick” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 11:21</span>). However, in most passages translators should avoid using a word that gives the impression that the user of the stick was somehow feeble or crippled or injured. Such a staff was carried by men of all ages and states of health.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 27:32</span>: The phrase “every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman’s staff” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is probably an allusion to the way in which animals were selected for the tithe. The animals were counted as they passed single file under the staff of the herdsman. Every tenth animal was marked with a red colored stick to show that it had been chosen for the tithe. If this image can be retained in the receptor-language translation while at the same time clearly conveying the idea of counting, then this will probably be better. But the details of the actual procedure are less important than the fact that one of every ten animals was to be designated as belonging to the LORD. One possible model for the whole verse is “When you count your animals, cattle, sheep or goats, every tenth animal must be marked as belonging to the LORD.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 23:4</span>: The Hebrew words <em>shevet</em> and <em>mish‘eneth</em> are used together in this verse as if they are distinguishable objects. We may quote from <em>A Handbook on Psalms</em>: “The <strong>\\+u rod\\+u*</strong> was a club used to drive away wild animals; the <strong>\\+u staff\\+u*</strong> was a long stick used for support in walking. Kirkpatrick takes the two words to be a poetic description of the shepherd’s crook, using two names for the one instrument. So <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr> ‘your shepherd’s rod, that is what reassures me.’ Most translations, however, have two different words. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> [that is, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>] has used the traditional ‘<strong>rod and staff</strong> ’; but since there will be many readers who will not know what these are, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> qualifies them with ‘<strong>Your shepherd’s rod and staff</strong> ’ ” (page 234).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Cor 4:21</span>: This is the only place where Paul uses the Greek word <em>rhabdos</em>, and its meaning must be determined from the context. It is very unlikely that Paul thinks of a literal stick with which he is threatening to beat his converts. It is also very unlikely that he thinks of himself as a ruler. His authority is “in Christ” (verses 15, 17), and he describes it as the authority of a father (verse 15) or a teacher. Both fathers and teachers had the acknowledged right to correct their children or pupils, if necessary, by using force. This idea is difficult to convey in the setting of many modern societies. Paul’s language also seems to have irony in it. Translators have found different ways of explaining or bringing out the meaning of the word <em>rhabdos</em>. Some maintain the image of the instrument of punishment (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">DUCL</abbr> “a rod in my hand”; Moffatt [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>] and Barclay [Brc] “rod of discipline”). Others focus on the element of punishment; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> begins the second question of this verse with “Do you want me to be hard on you,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “that I come to you with punishment.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has replaced the rod with a whip by saying “Shall I come to you with a whip.” This has been done presumably because a whip or strap is more familiar in English as an instrument of punishment. Some translators will want to follow this model and substitute an instrument better known in their society.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 11:21</span>: In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 47:31</span> the Hebrew word <em>m-t-h</em> can mean either “staff” or “bed,” depending on what vowels are given to the word (see the discussion at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">5.5 Bed, sleeping mat&lt;REALIA:5.5&gt;</a>). Most translations render it “bed.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> is an exception with “staff,” and it gives “bed” in the margin. The writer of Hebrews has followed the Septuagint, which has “staff.” The translator of Hebrews must not try to harmonize these verses but should translate the Greek of this verse, which can only mean “staff.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 2:27; Rev 12:5; Rev 19:15</span>: The literal phrase “to rule … with a rod of iron” appears in these three verses (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 2:9</span>). This means to rule completely, ruthlessly, crushing all opposition. The “iron rod” was probably a heavy wooden club capped with iron, not a club made of iron.

When the quarry steps on this network, its weight breaks through, and it falls into the pit and is trapped.","“Trap” (<em>pach</em>): This is a general word for a device used to trap animals or especially birds. Here it is explicitly identified as a trap that catches the bird by its foot (literally “heel”).","“Snare” (<em>tsamim</em>): This word may refer to some kind of woven material or mesh that entangles the feet.","“Rope” (<em>chevel</em>): This most likely refers to a hidden noose that is attached at the other end to a bent bough or small tree that springs upright and tightens the noose around the victim when the trap is sprung.","“Trap” (<em>malkodeth</em>): This is a general word for any kind of trap.","Because of the repetition in these three verses, some translations are considerably condensed. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> reduces the six words for traps to only three different words: “(8) Their feet will be caught in a net when they walk into its web. (9) A trap will catch them by the heel and hold them tight. (10) A trap for them is hidden on the ground, right in their path.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> condenses these verses even further: “(8) Before they know it, (9) they are trapped in a net, (10) hidden along the path.” See also the lengthy discussion on these verses in <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em>, pages 339-340.","For the Hebrew word <em>mazor</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Obad 1:7</span>, see the comments in <em>A Handbook on The Books of Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah</em>, page 15.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rom 11:9</span> the Greek words <em>thēra</em> and <em>skandalon</em> are treated as having literal meanings, whereas the passage as a whole is figurative.

As a result, in a number of languages the three terms are reduced often to two, for example, “snare” and “trap.” If there are three different kinds of traps, then, of course, three terms can be used. In some cases, however, it may be preferable to use words to express the acts of catching and trapping as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, which has “May they be caught and trapped at

The thread thus spun was wound onto the spindle. After the threads were prepared, it was necessary to interlace them at right angles. The <strong>loom</strong> was a device designed to weave cloth in this manner. In the horizontal loom, a series of threads were wound around a thick wooden beam and then tied to another beam. These threads, called the warp, were slightly separated and kept under tension. From the side of the warp another thread (called the woof or weft) was inserted, over the first warp thread, then under the next, and so on until it was passed through the entire warp. To aid this process, the woof thread was attached to a small flat piece of wood or bone, called the <strong>shuttle</strong>.

time of the Persians, money took the form of unstamped pieces of a precious metal such as silver or gold. Coins were only invented in the eighth century B.C., and they did not come into common use in the land of Israel until near the end of the Old Testament period. Coins were small disks made of various kinds of metal. They were stamped or minted with words, symbols, likenesses of leaders, and so on, as a means of identifying their origin and relative values.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Only in a few later writings of the Old Testament (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 29:7</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezra 2:69</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 5:15</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 7:70; Neh 7:71; Neh 7:72</span>) are actual coins in view. It will be necessary in translation to avoid the anachronism of having coins in the narrative at a time when they still had not been invented. While many translations may be technically correct to say “pieces of money,” avoiding the anachronistic mention of “coins,” this is perhaps not the best solution; the average reader will not understand “pieces of money” as meaning anything other than “coins.” In this case it may be better to stay with the literal expression “pieces of silver.” A translation should never use a word that indicates paper money, which did not exist in biblical times.","Where a generic term is lacking for the means of payment locally in use (such as certain seashells in some cultures), a generic plural of a commonly accepted local coin may be possible.","Part of the Greek text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Macc 15:6</span> is literally “to make your own coinage” (an activity usually reserved for a sovereign power). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “to mint your own coins” takes advantage of a special word in English for this operation. Not all languages have a word for coining or minting money. It is possible to follow the Greek fairly literally and make good sense in many cases.

In some languages a distinction must be made between these two aspects of such objects, and translators must make certain that the particular expression used in a receptor language will at least include the contents and not refer merely to the materials on which the words were written.","Scrolls varied in length but otherwise there was little difference between the physical construction of a short document and a long one. Thus, for example, the Hebrew word <em>sefer</em> may indicate a longer document (“book”), or it can also designate something shorter, which may best be translated “letter,” “writing,” or even “document”; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders it “papers” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 24:1</span> and “letter” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 5:6</span>.","Exceptionally long books might be written on more than one scroll. The Greek word <em>kefalis</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 10:7</span> refers to one such section or scroll of a book.","The codex, or bound book with individual pages, only came into use in the first century B.C. and in common use only a century or two later. Thus, all references to books in the Old Testament, in the Deuterocanon, and probably in the New Testament are to scrolls. Nevertheless, the closest equivalent in most languages for “scroll” is the term used today for “book,” and this will normally be the proper translation.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 29:11; Isa 29:12</span> the Hebrew verb <em>yada’</em> (“know”) occurs with the word <em>sefer</em> to indicate the ability to read and should be translated “knows how to read” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) or “can read” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 1:4</span> the word <em>sefer</em> may indicate either “literature/writings” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) or the ability “to read and write” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). In some languages the idea of literature may be unfamiliar, but there will probably be some way of talking about “written things,” and this may be the nearest equivalent available.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 7:14</span>: On the scroll in this passage were written the terms of agreement between a man and a woman entering into marriage.

The “lot” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) was probably a set of stones with special markings on them (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.9 Lots&lt;REALIA:4.9&gt;</a>). The stone chosen would show what God’s will was in that particular case. The “line” is the measuring line used to mark out the family plots. The lots may have been used to show where the measuring line should be placed. Most translators prefer to express the general procedure of parceling out the land and its significance rather than trying to render the specific instruments involved in the procedure; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “And so you will never again own property among the LORD’s people,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “So then, when the time comes for the land to be given back to the LORD’s people, there will be no share for any of you.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 11:1</span>: <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders the Greek phrase of three words near the beginning of this verse as “a measuring rod like a staff.” However, the meaning of the Greek is better expressed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> “a long cane like a measuring rod”; compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “a stick that looked like a measuring-rod,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> “a long cane to use as a measuring rod,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “a reed like a measuring rod,” and the Chewa common language translation, which has “a reed for measuring with that looked like a walking stick.” The first Greek word in this phrase is <em>kalamos</em>.

alt=\"WEB-0963_crown_thorns.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In some passages the crown serves only as a symbol of the office of king or queen. In those cultures where royalty (or the office of the supreme leader) is indicated by another symbol, this may be substituted for “crown.” Thus, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Esth 2:17</span> might read “he gave her the royal seal and made her queen in place of Vashti.” Similarly, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 21:4</span> might read “you seat him on the chief’s stool” or “you make him chief.”","In some passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 19:9; Job 31:36; Prov 12:4; Prov 16:31; Prov 17:6; Lam 5:16</span>) it is unclear from the context if the Hebrew word <em>‘atarah</em> refers to a crown or a wreath (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">6.8 Wreath, crown&lt;REALIA:6.8&gt;</a>).","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Macc 11:13</span> as “Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.” This literal rendering can create a rather silly picture in the mind of the reader. The crowns, of course, simply represent the authority held by Ptolemy in the two regions mentioned here. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has avoided the image of a king trying to balance two crowns on his head by saying “Ptolemy went to the city of Antioch, where he crowned himself king—both of Syria and of Egypt.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> ’s rendering, however, gives the mis­impression that he became king of Syria and Egypt simultaneously.

Ovens, of course, could be put to many uses. Where a language does not have a variety of words, such as “oven,” “furnace” and “kiln” in English, a single word will normally suffice.

While not ruling out the possibility that the anointing here is for medical purposes, there are certainly other factors involved.

The basic concept, however, remained the same: the sword was a long, heavy knife made of metal, at first of bronze, and later of harder metals like iron. In earlier biblical times the blade tended to be more for cutting; it was curved similar to a sickle (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.6 Sickle&lt;REALIA:1.1.6&gt;</a>), but it was sharpened only on the outside of the curve, unlike the sickle, which was sharpened on the inside of the curve. With this type of sword for cutting, no emphasis was placed on a point for piercing. In the later Old Testament period, swords were made more for piercing. These swords, which were as short as 30-40 centimeters (12-16 inches) at first, had relatively broad, pointed blades that were sharpened on both sides. By the time of the Israelite kings, the blades had become longer and relatively narrower.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In a number of languages the term for “sword” is simply “large knife,” but in some regions it may be called “machete for killing” or “war knife.”","The Hebrew word <em>cherev</em> is a general term and does not specify whether the sword is long or short. Where a language makes a distinction, it will generally be best to translate it “short sword.” In the New Testament the Greek word <em>machaira</em> refers to a short sword and <em>rhomfaia</em> is a long sword. The phrase “with/by the edge of the sword” (occurring over 30 times with over half of them in Joshua and Judges) usually has in view the older, curved sword, which had only one edge. Normally it will not be necessary to render this expression literally, but it will be sufficient to say something like “with/by the sword.”","In many passages we find the phrase “die by the sword” or “slain by the sword” (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 36:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 5:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 21:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 31:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 26:52</span>). This is an idiomatic expression meaning to die a violent death. It normally (but not always; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:33</span>) means to die in war, and translators may often use an expression such as “killed in war” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 16:4</span>) or “die in battle.” In such cases it usually indicates a non-heroic death; where a language has a special word or phrase for “die the death of a warrior,” the translator should not use that expression unless such a death is what is intended by the biblical text. In cases where death in warfare is not the meaning, one may say “die a violent death” or “killed by people.” One should not substitute a modern weapon for “sword”; for example, it would be anachronistic to say “shot to death.”","In some passages the word “sword” simply stands for warfare, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 5:12; Rom 8:35; Rev 6:8</span>. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 24:12</span> says literally “Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, [but] not by your sword or your bow” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>). It may be preferable in some languages to translate the last part of this verse without naming the specific weapons: “Your weapons and strength had nothing to do with it.” It is also possible to translate this with both a positive and negative statement: “I defeated them for you. It was not your own strength and weapons that did it.”","The phrase “men who drew the sword” occurs in a number of passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:10; Judg 8:20</span> [6 times]; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 24:9; 1 Chr 21:5</span>). This is simply an idiomatic expression for “soldiers,” which is the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> rendering in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:10</span>.","The phrase “lift up the sword” occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 2:4</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 4:3</span> with the meaning “go into battle” or “go to war.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> gives the correct English equivalent by rendering the second to last line in each of these verses as “Nations will never again go to war.” In some languages a literal rendering of the idiom “to lift up the sword” will have quite a different meaning, such as “to surrender” or “to be victorious.” This is not the meaning of the text and should be avoided.","The Hebrew phrase <em>cherev pifiyoth</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 149:6</span>) or <em>cherev piyoth</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 5:4</span>) refers to a sword sharpened on both edges of the blade, that is, a “two-edged sword” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 4:12; Rev 1:16; Rev 2:12; Sir 21:3</span>). This is the straight sword of later Old Testament times and onward.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:5</span> the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>mkerah</em> is doubtful. Most translators connect Jacob’s words to the events described in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 34:25; Gen 34:26</span> and understand <em>mkerah</em> to be a kind of weapon, probably parallel to the “sword” (<em>cherev</em> in Hebrew) in those verses.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 55:22</span> the Hebrew word <em>pthichoth</em> refers to swords that are “drawn” (literally “open”), that is, ready for use. Thus, for the last line of this verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “and he was ready to attack with a sword.” Others prefer to use a simile; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “but they [his words] cut like sharp swords” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “… cut like knives.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 2:35</span> the word “sword” is used figuratively for pain or anguish. Often translators can use a rather literal rendering. Sometimes it is preferable to shift to a simile; for example, the first half of this verse may be rendered “As for your soul, it will be as if a sword pierced it.” In some cases the equivalent expression does not need a term for “sword,” for example, “and you too shall be pierced to the heart” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>). It is also pos­sible to use a nonfigurative expression, for example, “you will experience anguish.” There is no implication here of a military death, and the translator should avoid the use of a term that might carry that implication."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֶרֶב","transliteration":"cherev","references":["Gen 3:24","Gen 27:40","Gen 31:26","Gen 34:25","Gen 34:26","Gen

The word <em>‘agaloth</em> is related to the Hebrew word for “round,” and this makes it likely that the smaller, round shield is intended. Ancient shields were most commonly made of wood and leather, and frequently rubbed with olive oil. As a result they would burn easily. Where shields are known only to be made of metal, it may be helpful to include a note explaining how shields can be set on fire.","The Hebrew word <em>shemesh</em>, which normally means “sun,” also carries the meaning of a round shield that formed part of the protection at the top of a city wall (see the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">2.19.3 Firing platform, siege tower&lt;REALIA:2.19.3&gt;</a>). Thus, the phrase “sun and shield” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 84:10</span> speaks of two types of shield. Most modern translations wrongly retain “sun,” but compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, which has “rampart and shield.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> gives “bulwark” in the margin. “Protector and glorious king” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> keeps the idea of “sun” in “glorious king,” but it reverses the order as it is found in the Hebrew."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָגֵן","transliteration":"magen","references":["Gen 15:1","Deut 33:29","Judg 5:8","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 22:3","2 Sam 22:31","2 Sam 22:36","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 14:26","1 Kgs 14:27","2 Kgs 19:32","1 Chr 5:18","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 12:9","2 Chr 12:10","2 Chr 14:7","2 Chr 17:17","2 Chr 23:9","2 Chr 26:14","2 Chr 32:5","2 Chr 32:27","Neh 4:10","Job 15:26","Job 41:7","Ps 3:4","Ps 7:11","Ps 18:3","Ps 18:31","Ps 18:36","Ps 28:7","Ps 33:20","Ps 35:2","Ps 47:10","Ps 59:12","Ps 76:4","Ps 84:10","Ps 84:12","Ps 89:19","Ps 115:9","Ps 115:10","Ps 115:11","Ps 119:114","Ps 144:2","Prov 2:7","Prov 6:11","Prov 24:34","Prov 30:5","Song 4:4","Isa 21:5","Isa 22:6","Isa 37:33","Jer 46:3","Jer 46:9","Ezek 23:24","Ezek 27:10","Ezek 38:4","Ezek 38:5","Ezek 39:9","Nah 2:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"עֲגָלָה","transliteration":"‘agalah","references":["Ps 46:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֶׁלֶט","transliteration":"shelet","references":["2 Sam 8:7","2 Kgs 11:10","1 Chr 18:7","2 Chr 23:9","Song 4:4","Jer 51:11","Ezek 27:11"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֶׁמֶשׁ","transliteration":"shemesh","references":["Ps 84:12","Isa 54:12"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Gen 15:1","Deut 33:29","Judg 5:8","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 22:3","2 Sam 22:31","2 Sam 22:36","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 14:26","1 Kgs 14:27","2 Kgs 19:32","1 Chr 5:18","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 12:9","2 Chr 12:10","2 Chr 14:7","2 Chr 17:17","2 Chr 23:9","2 Chr 26:14","2 Chr 32:5","2 Chr 32:27","Neh 4:10","Job 15:26","Job 41:7","Ps 3:4","Ps 7:11","Ps 18:3","Ps 18:31","Ps 18:36","Ps 28:7","Ps 33:20","Ps 35:2","Ps 47:10","Ps 59:12","Ps 76:4","Ps 84:10","Ps 84:12","Ps 89:19","Ps 115:9","Ps 115:10","Ps 115:11","Ps 119:114","Ps 144:2","Prov 2:7","Prov 6:11","Prov 24:34","Prov 30:5","Song 4:4","Isa 21:5","Isa 22:6","Isa 37:33","Jer 46:3","Jer 46:9","Ezek 23:24","Ezek 27:10","Ezek 38:4","Ezek 38:5","Ezek 39:9","Nah 2:4","Ps 46:10","2 Sam 8:7","2 Kgs 11:10","1 Chr 18:7","Jer 51:11","Ezek 27:11","Isa 54:12"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.11","book":"realia","title":"Leg armor, leg protectors","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"reference","heading":"Reference:","headingHtml":"Reference:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מִצְחָה","transliteration":"mitschah","references":["1 Sam 17:6"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Leg armor was protective armor for the lower leg.

Composite bows in particular were very stiff and difficult to string. The underlying idea is preparing the bow for combat. Possible renderings for “bend the bow” are “string the bow” and “prepare the bow for use.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:3</span> a <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “Don’t let the Babylonian soldiers prepare their bows to shoot.”","In some passages the word “bow” symbolizes warfare.

In wartime an attacking army had to find a way to get past the wall and into the city. Five methods were available to the attacker to conquer a fortified city, all of which are reflected in the Bible: 1) penetration over the top of the fortifications; 2) penetration through the fortifications; 3) penetration below the fortifications; 4) penetration by ruse or trickery (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 8:0</span>); and 5) siege. Penetration from above was usually done by scaling the walls using ladders (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:7; Joel 2:8; Joel 2:9</span>). Going through the wall could be done by chopping it with hammers, axes, and other tools, by breaking it down using a catapult, or by breaking or burning the gates (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:58</span>). Frequently, however, this was accomplished with a battering ram (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 21:22</span>). The attack on the wall was often aided by the building of a siege tower, which put the attackers on a level with the defenders on the wall, making it easier to attack them with arrows and javelins. Penetration from below usually meant the long process of digging a tunnel under the wall. Sometimes, however, it was possible to use an existing tunnel, such as a shaft connecting the city to its water supply (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 5:8</span>).","Defenders of a city were equally ingenious in finding methods to neutralize the efforts of the attacking army. Ladders were pushed over, second walls were built behind the first wall that was about to fall, and large stones or even burning objects could be thrown down on attackers who got close to the wall. In order to protect soldiers working or attacking near the wall, the attacking army would build a large kind of shield that covered the soldiers from above. This device is mentioned by the prophet Nahum: “The attackers rush to the wall and set up the shield for the battering ram” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 2:6</span> b).","When an army did not have the equipment to use one of these methods, or when the terrain was too difficult for an attack, the attacking army could just close off all exits from the city and sit tight. This was called a siege. Its objective was to wait until the people inside the city ran out of food or water and were then ready to surrender (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 25:0</span>)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.19.1","book":"realia","title":"Siege wall","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דָּיֵק","transliteration":"dayeq","references":["2 Kgs 25:1","Jer 52:4","Ezek 4:2","Ezek 17:17","Ezek 21:27","Ezek 26:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָצוֹד","transliteration":"matsod","references":["Eccl 9:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָצוֹר","transliteration":"matsor","references":["Deut 20:20","Ezek 4:2","Mic 4:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סלל","transliteration":"salal (verb)","references":["Job 19:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"χάραξ","transliteration":"charax","references":["Luke 19:43","PrMan 3:12"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The siege wall was a fence of poles or stakes used to fortify entrenchments.

The collection is also called ‘The Book of Pilgrim Songs.’ The Hebrew word translated <strong>Ascents</strong> comes from the verb ‘to go up,’ but other than this there is no agreement as to what the phrase means. Some take it to indicate the return of the Hebrew exiles from Babylonia; others take it to refer to a stylistic feature found in some of the psalms, in which the order of the statement progresses in a step-like fashion from one verse to the other; others take it to refer to the steps in the Temple precincts which led from one court to the other; the majority take it to refer to the ascent up the mountain on which the Temple was built (Mount Moriah, known as Mount Zion).

Where a language distinguishes between the two, the context should be checked carefully.

It has also been suggested that, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 18:3</span> Paul, Aquila and Priscilla made tents for military use, although the Greek word traditionally translated “tentmaker” more properly means “leather worker.”","It should be kept in mind that in Israel’s earlier history, many people lived in tents. The phrase “went to his tent” or “fled to their tents” often means simply “went home”; for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 14:12</span> is literally “every man fled to his tent,” but, because the context tells us that they lived in houses, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> says “every man fled to his home.”","The Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> means “dwelling place” and is used most often for the Tabernacle in the wilderness (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15.2 Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15.2&gt;</a>). In the passages listed above it refers specifically to a tent for people to live in (either as nomads or as soldiers). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 24:5; Isa 54:2</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 30:18</span><em>mishkan</em> appears in poetic parallelism with a word for “tent.” In these places it will be best to use a general word meaning “dwelling place,” “residence.”","The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>qubah</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 25:8</span> is uncertain.

There will normally be no need to express this in translation. This word is used as a metaphor in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:8</span> for God establishing the earth. Several translations choose to replace the “column” or “pillar” metaphor with “foundations” (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:29</span>: It is most likely that the columns which Samson pushed were made of wood, essentially large logs.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:15; 1 Kgs 7:16; 1 Kgs 7:17; 1 Kgs 7:18; 1 Kgs 7:19; 1 Kgs 7:20; 1 Kgs 7:21; 1 Kgs 7:22</span>: Particular difficulties are presented by the description of the two special bronze columns placed by Solomon on either side of the entrance to the Temple. These columns were even given names.","While <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:15</span> describes the two columns, the Hebrew text makes use of a typical figure of speech, ellipsis: when speaking of the <em>first</em> column and its <em>height</em>, it is understood that the same applies to the <em>second</em> column too; when speaking, then, of the <em>second</em> column and its <em>circumference</em>, it is understood again that the same applies to the <em>first</em> column also. A translation should not try to retain this rather confusing device. While it is possible to describe the dimensions of one of the columns and then add that the second column was the same (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), it is better to give a combined description of the two. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “He made two bronze pillars, each one twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet around.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> tries to make the picture even clearer by changing the circumference to an easier-to-visualize diameter: “Hiram made two bronze columns twenty-seven feet tall and about six feet across.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> ’s footnote gives the metric equivalents of the height and circumference: about 8.1 meters high and about 5.4 meters around.","There is an unclear text at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:17</span>, which describes the design of the capitals on these columns, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> both indicate the difficulty in a footnote. Nevertheless, the translator must supply a rendering that makes sense. Thus it is inadequate to provide a literal but unintelligible translation like that of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>: “There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.” It should be kept in mind that this is a description of a decorative design that somehow incorporated a network (or “mesh/lattice-work”) in which chains could be found. This should be conveyed to the reader in a description that is as simple as possible. Good examples are <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “The caps [capitals] were decorated with seven rows of designs that looked like chains.” The same idea is probably reflected in the parallel text at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 3:16</span>, where the Hebrew word <em>dvir</em> (normally referring to the Holy of Holies) is thought to be a transposition of the Hebrew letters from the word <em>ravid</em>, which means a kind of chain or necklace. For the first half of this verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has “He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:19</span> speaks of capitals in the shape of “lilies” (<em>shushan</em> in Hebrew). It is impossible to know what their exact shape was. While the word <em>shushan</em> is usually translated “lily,” it probably served to designate several kinds of flower. So the Jerusalem Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>) renders it “flower-shaped,” which, however, could be misleading in some contexts. Where lilies are not known, translators should choose a local flower with a head shaped like a cup.","As part of the description of the two bronze columns, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:20</span> uses the Hebrew word <em>beten</em>, which literally means “belly.” This is understood by most translations to be a kind of projection protruding all around the top of each column. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> uses the technical architectural term “cushion,” which will be inappropriate for a common-language translation. Other renderings are “bowl-shaped part/section” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>) and “rounded section/tops” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 38:6</span>: The Hebrew word <em>’adanim</em> is used here in a manner similar to the use of <em>matsuq</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:8</span>, discussed above. The writer of Job thought of the earth as a building set on pillars. These pillars in turn rested on bases. The reference is to the “bases” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) or “footings” on which the pillars rest. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> translates the first line of this verse clearly, saying “On what do its supporting pillars rest?” This line may require more information to make it clear, for example, “On what do the bases rest that hold up the pillars of the earth?” or “What is beneath the footings that support the pillars holding up the earth?”","All the New Testament references to “pillar” are figurative. Some translations prefer to express the meaning rather than retain the pillar figure; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gal 2:9</span>, where “pillars” refers to the leaders in the church, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “the backbone of the church,” while <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “the leaders.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דְּבִיר","transliteration":"dvir","references":["2 Chr

In some instances the fence may consist of piled up logs or sticks; in other instances it may be made of packed dirt or of laid-up stone. What is important, however, is not the form of the “fence,” but its function, and therefore translators may often use a descriptive expression, for example, “barrier to surround a field” or “barrier to keep animals out of the field.” Because stone was such a common material in the land of Israel, fences were usually made of loose stones. In many cultures such stone structures are called “walls,” not “fences.”","The Hebrew word <em>gvul</em>, which normally means “boundary” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.7 Boundary marker&lt;REALIA:3.7&gt;</a>), is used in several places in Ezekiel with a somewhat different meaning. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:12</span> it seems to refer to a “low wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “railing” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), or simply “barrier[s]” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 43:13; Ezek 43:17; Ezek 43:20</span> the word describes a kind of “rim” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) around the base and different levels of the altar.","Some languages distinguish between the outer wall of a building and the inner walls that separate rooms. The Hebrew word <em>chomah</em> normally indicates an outer wall, specifically of a city (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.1&gt;</a>). The references listed above are exceptional. The other Hebrew words can be used for both inner and outer walls, and the translator must decide the correct meaning from the context. The Greek word <em>toichos</em> refers to an inner wall. In translation the outer wall of a house may be called “side of a house,” and an inner wall may be referred to as “partition in a house.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 13:10</span>: In this verse the Hebrew word <em>chayits</em> indicates a “divider,” a wall that is temporary and not very substantial. Translations attempt to indicate this by the addition of a modifier, such as “shaky” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), “flimsy” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, Living Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>]), “weak” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>), “unstable” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>), or “of loose stones” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>).","The Hebrew words <em>shur</em> and <em>shurah</em> have been understood in various ways. They literally mean “row.” This could mean a row of stones, so a wall or a fence. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:22</span> most translations have “wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>). However, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 24:11</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders <em>shurah</em> as “olive rows.” As pointed out by <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em>, this not likely to be the meaning of the text. Olive trees in the Middle East are very often grown on specially prepared terraces. The terraces themselves are supported by retaining walls, which could be the meaning of <em>shurah</em> here. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr> has abandoned the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> rendering with “terraces” (also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> says “garden,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr> has “walls.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> choose not to translate the word.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eph 2:14</span> the Greek words <em>mesotoichon</em> and <em>fragmos</em> are used figuratively of the Law, which constituted a barrier between Jews and Gentiles, “the wall of separation” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>).

a variety of roads, either shorter ones within a town or village or longer ones between cities and even countries. Most roads were not paved but were simply paths worn by the passage of many feet and vehicles. Some roads between cites (especially in the Roman period) and more streets within cities and towns were paved, usually with stones.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Some languages contain a wide variety of words for roads within settled areas like towns or cities and also between such urban units. Hebrew and Greek are no exception, with at least a dozen such words. While some of the words are general terms, others indicate roads differing in width, length, or purpose. Translators will, of course, want to choose words in their language that take the context into consideration.","Most of the roads mentioned in the Bible would have been local ways that were little more than wide walking paths. These were usually unpaved, followed the topography, and for the most part would not have been used by vehicles. Some of the roads mentioned in the New Testament were Roman roads and were specially prepared and paved with stone. This kind of road is mentioned, for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 10:46</span>. Strictly speaking, the roads within towns were not “man-made” in the sense that they were not specially constructed according to some plan. They were simply the product of the space between buildings.","Some languages make a distinction between a road inside a town or city and one that passes through the countryside. Where the context is not clear and the language does not have a generic word for “road,” it will usually be best to select a word for a road that connects towns.","As with many languages, words for thoroughfares in Hebrew and Greek often serve figuratively to indicate the “way” a person lives or does something; for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:1</span> praises the person who does not “follow the example of sinners” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). The Hebrew text says literally “does not stand in the way of sinners.” Here a literal translation into English is a mistranslation, because the English idiom “to stand in someone’s way” means to prevent them from acting. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> renders this verse literally by saying “Blessed is the man who does not … stand in the way of sinners … ,” which praises the person who allows sinners to do wrong. This, of course, is not the message of the text.","It is not clear just what Solomon built with algum wood in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:11</span>. The hilly topography of Jerusalem and the fact that Solomon used wood indicate that he could have made a kind of path “paved” with wood or even a kind of “boardwalk.” For the Hebrew word <em>msilah</em><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> has “ramps,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr> says “walkways.” Many translations say “steps” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>) here but inconsistently translate this word everywhere else as “highway,” “road,” or “path.”","The Hebrew words <em>ma’gal</em> and <em>ma’galah</em> are related to the word for “wagon” or “ox-cart” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">8.2 Cart, wagon&lt;REALIA:8.2&gt;</a>) and indicate the track in which the wheels of a wagon would go.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:2</span>: The word “streets” in this verse follows the Greek text and is the rendering of most translations (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>); Anchor Bible has “market places.” In some languages it may sound odd to have the people standing out in the middle of busy streets praying; any place where large crowds of people normally gather for daily activities, such as “marketplaces” or “street corners” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), would seem a more satisfactory rendering. So instead of “in the streets,” translators may say “out in the middle of towns” or “in the busy parts of towns.” Also in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jdt 1:14</span> the rendering “marketplaces” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) is better than “streets.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹרַח","transliteration":"’orach","references":["Gen 49:17","Judg 5:6","Job 8:13","Job 13:27","Job 16:22","Job 19:8","Job 22:15","Job

In this place, town administration meetings (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 21:19</span>), legal transactions (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:11</span>), and markets (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 7:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 7:18</span>) were held (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5 City gate&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5&gt;</a>). It will sometimes be possible in translation to indicate the place by the activity that is taking place there rather than by a word that corresponds to “square.” A good example of this is the way <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:7</span>. The Hebrew reads literally “When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>); <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “Whenever the city elders met and I took my place among them.” Compare also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 7:12</span>: “or stood waiting at a corner, sometimes in the streets, sometimes in the marketplace.”","While most translations and commentaries understand the Hebrew word <em>rchov</em> to mean “city square,” some understand it in the more general sense of “street” in some passages (and this indeed has become its only meaning in modern Hebrew); for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> renders it “street[s]” in all but three instances, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, while usually rendering <em>rchov</em> as “square[s],” has “streets” in about one-third of its appearances. By way of example, most translations render <em>rchovoth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 9:25</span> as “streets”; some common-language translations (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">ITCL</abbr>) avoid a direct translation of <em>rchovoth</em> by speaking of “Jerusalem” being reconstructed."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"רְחֹב","transliteration":"rchov","references":["Gen 19:2","Deut 13:17","Judg 19:15","Judg 19:17","Judg 19:20","2 Sam 21:12","2 Chr 29:4","2 Chr 32:6","Ezra 10:9","Neh 8:1","Neh 8:3","Neh 8:16","Neh 8:16","Esth 4:6","Esth 6:9","Esth 6:11","Job 29:7","Ps 55:12","Ps 144:14","Prov 1:20","Prov 5:16","Prov 7:12","Prov 22:13","Prov 26:13","Song 3:2","Isa 15:3","Isa 59:14","Jer 5:1","Jer 9:20","Jer 48:38","Jer 49:26","Jer 50:30","Lam 2:11","Lam 2:12","Lam 4:18","Ezek 16:24","Ezek 16:31","Dan 9:25","Amos 5:16","Nah 2:5","Zech 8:4","Zech 8:5","Zech 8:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀγορά","transliteration":"agora","references":["Matt 11:16","Matt 20:3","Matt 23:7","Mark 6:56","Mark 7:4","Mark 12:38","Luke 7:32","Luke 11:43","Luke 20:46","Acts 16:19","Acts 17:17","Tob 2:3","2 Macc 10:2","Ps 151 2:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀγορανομία","transliteration":"agoranomia","references":["2 Macc 3:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"εὐρύχωρος","transliteration":"euruchōros","references":["Ps 151 5:46","Ps 151 9:6","Ps 151 9:38","Ps 151 9:41"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Gen 19:2","Deut 13:17","Judg 19:15","Judg 19:17","Judg 19:20","2 Sam 21:12","2 Chr 29:4","2 Chr 32:6","Ezra 10:9","Neh 8:1","Neh 8:3","Neh 8:16","Esth 4:6","Esth 6:9","Esth 6:11","Job 29:7","Ps 55:12","Ps 144:14","Prov 1:20","Prov 5:16","Prov 7:12","Prov 22:13","Prov 26:13","Song 3:2","Isa 15:3","Isa 59:14","Jer 5:1","Jer 9:20","Jer 48:38","Jer 49:26","Jer 50:30","Lam 2:11","Lam 2:12","Lam 4:18","Ezek 16:24","Ezek 16:31","Dan 9:25","Amos 5:16","Nah 2:5","Zech 8:4","Zech 8:5","Matt 11:16","Matt 20:3","Matt 23:7","Mark 6:56","Mark 7:4","Mark 12:38","Luke 7:32","Luke 11:43","Luke 20:46","Acts 16:19","Acts 17:17","Tob 2:3","2 Macc 10:2","Ps 151 2:14","2 Macc 3:4","Ps 151 5:46","Ps 151 9:6","Ps 151 9:38","Ps 151 9:41"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.13.3","book":"realia","title":"City fortifications","depth":2,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.1","label":"3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement","text":"3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.2","label":"3.13.3.2 Fortress, stronghold, castle, citadel, fort","text":"3.13.3.2 Fortress, stronghold, castle, citadel, fort"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.3","label":"3.13.3.3 Watchtower, tower","text":"3.13.3.3 Watchtower, tower"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.4","label":"3.13.3.4 Moat","text":"3.13.3.4 Moat"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.5","label":"3.13.3.5 City gate","text":"3.13.3.5 City gate"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Ancient cities were often built with special fortifications to protect the inhabitants from attacks from the outside.

However, such a fence may not be wide enough for people to walk on. Where the text speaks of people walking or doing other things on the city wall, translators should avoid creating a picture that will look impossible or ridiculous to the readers. In such cases, it may be necessary to expand with something like “thick fence made of stones around a city” or “fortified fence around a city.”","The Hebrew words <em>chel</em> and <em>chomah</em> appear several times parallel to each other. There may be some distinction between them, where <em>chel</em> speaks of extra fortification or strengthening of a <em>chomah</em>. However, where only one term for a city wall exists, it will usually be possible to treat them as one term. Where <em>chel</em> and its related terms stand alone, translators may add a modifier, saying “strong wall” or “fortified wall.”","In a few places (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 25:16; Prov 18:11; Song 8:9; Song 8:10; Isa 26:1; Jer 15:20; Zech 2:9</span>) the word <em>chomah</em> is used figuratively, signifying strength or protection. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 25:16</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has dropped the wall figure and begins simply with “They protected us.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:15</span> refers to Rahab’s “house built into the city wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). Archaeological excavations reveal that at one time Jericho had two city walls, an inner one and an outer one, separated by a space of about 3.5 to 4.5 meters (11.5-14.5 feet). Houses were built on heavy timbers laid from one wall to the other. The window through which Rahab let the men down looked out from the outer wall. The phrase “a house built into the city wall” could possibly be unclear; it may be more satisfactory to translate “a section of the city wall formed the outside wall of Rahab’s house.” Moreover, it may even be necessary to include a footnote, indicating more precisely the relation between the house and the city wall.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jdt 14:1</span>: Where a technical term for

Large gates could also be found at the entrances to large complexes such as the Temple or the residences of the rich. Gateway construction varied at different periods, having two, four, or six parallel guardrooms on either side of the gateway. At other times gateways were built having one or more ninety degree turns, usually to the left (in order to expose the side of the attacking soldier which was not covered by his shield). The entrance of the gateway was closed by a thick door, normally made of wood. The door was usually made of two parts, each part hanging on hinges from each side of the gateway. These two parts of the gate were pushed together and then secured in place by one or more heavy wooden bars from the inside (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5.1 Gate bar, bolt&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5.1&gt;</a>).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In most of the passages listed above (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 14:13</span>), the reference is to the entranceway and not specifically to the gates as objects. In some passages, however (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:3</span>), it is the doors of the entranceway that are in focus. In many cultures walled towns with gates are unknown, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:3</span> it may be necessary to expand the literal clause “he took hold of the doors of the gate of the city” as follows: “he took hold of the large doors in the wall that surrounded the city.”","In ancient cities, business and discussion were often conducted in the gateway (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 23:10; Gen 23:18; Ruth 4:1; Ruth 4:11</span>; see also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.2 Square, marketplace&lt;REALIA:3.13.2&gt;</a>). It was the place where the elders or important men of the city gathered (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:7</span>). The city gate could also serve as a place of judgment (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 21:19; Josh 20:4</span>) or punishment (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 17:5; Deut 22:24</span>). <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 31:21</span> probably refers to the city gate as a place of judgment also. The second line of this verse is literally “because I saw my help in the gate.” This refers to having the support and backing of the other officials in the town. If Job had wanted to mistreat anyone, he could have counted on those men who sat on the town council to defend him. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “knowing I could win in court” means that Job has the support of the local court system (that met at the city gate) to defend his case. We may also render the whole verse as “I have never threatened to harm an orphan, even though I knew the officials would be on my side if I did.” <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 127:5</span> also refers to the city gate as a court. The second half of this verse is literally “He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). The “enemies in the gate” are a man’s adversaries in a legal dispute; the open space near the inner gate of the city was the place where legal disputes were settled. If he had a number of grown sons with him, a man would be more likely to win in a legal dispute with his adversaries. In some languages there is a term for a designated place in the village where village elders meet for hearings. In cases where there is no such customary place, “in the gate” is sometimes rendered “in the place where men meet to decide matters.” Compare also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 22:22; Prov 24:7; Prov 31:23; Isa 29:21; Lam 5:14; Amos 5:10; Amos 5:12; Amos 5:15; Zech 8:16</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 22:17; Gen 24:60</span>: The literal expression “shall possess the gates of their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 22:17</span> is an idiomatic way of saying “will conquer their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) or “will defeat their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 20:10</span>: Here a Hebrew idiom speaks of people who are “within your gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). This refers to the territory controlled by someone. So <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “in your country,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> uses “in your towns,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “in your cities.” Compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 5:14; Deut 12:12; Deut 12:15; Deut 12:18; Deut 12:18; Deut 12:21; Deut 14:21; Deut 14:27; Deut 14:28; Deut 14:29; Deut 15:7</span>. Generally this idiom may be rendered “in your land,” “in your towns,” or “in your cities.” The expression should not be misunderstood as referring to people who, by a different metaphor, “sit in the gate,” that is, are members of the local leadership.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 3:11</span>: In the literal expression “the whole gate of my people,” “gate” refers to the city, and “the whole gate” is a reference to the whole city in the sense of “all the people of the city” or “all of the citizens.” It is rare that a translator can use a term for “gate” in reference to a city. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:10</span> speaks literally of Mahlon’s name not being “cut off … from the gate of his place.” Here again “gate” is a metonym for the whole town. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> expresses this positively, saying “his family line will continue … in his hometown.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> is also good: “he will be remembered in this town.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 18:24</span>: The literal phrase “between the two gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) reflects the construction of city gates. The stronger walled cities had an outer and an inner gate, with a covered passage or narrow entrance hall between them. Along the sides of the passage were usually rooms occupied by guards (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5.2 Guardroom&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5.2&gt;</a>). The translator can make the picture reasonably clear with an expanded translation, for example, “between the inner and outer gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) or “between the inner and outer gates of the city” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> is similar to <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and adds the following note: “The city gate was often like a tower in the city wall, with one gate on the outside of the wall and another gate on the inside of the wall.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:31</span>: “and let her works praise her in the gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). Here “gates” stands for the place where people gather, a public place. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> says “praise her in public for what she has done” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>), and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “She deserves the respect of everyone.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 16:18</span>: The literal phrase “the gates of Hades” is an idiom for death or the power that death holds over humanity. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> have “the powers of death.” For the last clause of this verse, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> says “death itself will not have any power over it.” There is a parallel expression in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 38:10</span>, where Hezekiah complains that the little time he has to live will be dominated by the fact of his impending death: “I had thought: I must depart in the middle of my days; I have been consigned to the gates of Sheol [meaning ‘world of the dead’] For the rest of my years” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). Compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>: “I thought that in the prime of life I was going to the world of the dead, Never to live out my life.” In both passages the translator should not try to retain the reference to gates unless it will be natural in the receptor language; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 38:10</span> in English, Hezekiah might speak of being “at death’s door.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 3:2</span>: There are two opinions concerning the identification of the gate mentioned only in this passage. Some authorities believe it was the Nicanor Gate, made of polished Corinthian bronze, which according to Josephus exceeded all the other gates in value and which gave access from the Women’s Court to the Court of Israel. But from the context, which says that Peter and John were “going in,” it seems more probable the gate here called “Beautiful” was the Golden Gate, also called Shushan. Jewish tradition knows nothing about a gate called the Beautiful Gate. However, translators do not need to concern themselves with the identification of the gate; it is sufficient to say “the Beautiful Gate” or “the gate called Beautiful.” Translators normally capitalize the name of the gate.","About 40 verses make reference to “gatekeeper[s].” A gatekeeper was a man who was responsible to sit by a closed gate and identify those desiring to enter. He would open the gate (of the city, the Temple, a palace, or perhaps to the courtyard of a rich man) only for those who were allowed to enter."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דֶּלֶת","transliteration":"deleth","references":["Deut 3:5","Josh 6:26","Judg 16:3","1 Sam 21:14","1 Sam 23:7","1 Kgs 16:34","2 Chr 8:5","2 Chr

It is possible, however, to see a parallelism between the first two lines of the verse and the last two lines, where “gate bar” in the first line is parallel to “scepter” (<em>shevet</em> in Hebrew) in the third line. This would mean that the gate bar is a metaphor for the ruler. Of the translations consulted, only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> comes close to this approach with “I shall crush the nobles of Damascus ... and the sceptred ruler of Beth-eden.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 3:13</span>: It is not clear whether the bars and gates mentioned here are to be taken literally or figuratively. If they are understood figuratively, then the “bars” probably stand for the fortresses that guarded the mountain passes, which are called “gates” earlier in the verse. If they are understood literally, then the “bars” would be the wooden beams that prevented the gates of Nineveh from being opened. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> follows this interpretation and renders the last half of this verse as “Fire will destroy the bars across your gates.” Probably it is better either to take both the gates and bars as figurative, or both as literal. If translators take both the gates and bars as figurative, a possible translation model is “The borders of your land are wide open to your enemies, and fire will destroy your fortresses.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 3:3; Neh 3:6; Neh 3:13; Neh 3:14; Neh 3:15</span> lists both <em>briach</em> and <em>man‘ul</em> as part of the gate. They were in fact parts of the system for securing the gate from the inside so that it could not be opened. The Hebrew word <em>briach</em> refers to a pole or bar, while the word <em>man‘ul</em> comes from a root meaning “to close.” Most translations render the two objects as “bolts and bars.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “metal bolts and wooden beams as locks” suggests the materials from which these objects were made and the function they served. The exact structure and function of the <em>man‘ul</em> is not clear.

From the time it was first built by Solomon, it was the center of worship for the Jewish people. In Jewish history three temples were constructed, all of them quite different from the others. The first Temple, built by Solomon, was destroyed in 587/586 B.C. A new, more modest Temple was built about seventy years later by Zerubbabel and lasted until almost the time of the New Testament, when it was rebuilt by Herod the Great.

In the New Testament the Greek word <em>naos</em> refers to a single building, while the word <em>hieron</em> points to the entire Temple precinct with its buildings, courts, and storerooms. Even though in a number of contexts it is not necessary to distinguish between <em>hieron</em> and <em>naos</em>, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 21:12</span> (and the parallel passages <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 11:15; Luke 19:45; John 2:14</span>), it is important to indicate this distinction in order not to leave the impression that sacrificial animals were actually being sold inside the central sanctuary.

People could bring their donations (not coins, which were not yet invented) and insert them into the box through the hole. The donations could then be removed by opening or removing the top.","In some passages the Hebrew word <em>’otsar</em> refers to treasure (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 24:13; 2 Chr 12:9</span>), while in other places it indicates the place where treasure was stored, that is, a treasury (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 20:13; 2 Chr 32:27</span>). The first half of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 15:18</span> says literally “And Asa took all the remaining silver and gold in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and [he took] the treasures of the king’s house.” No translation consulted makes the distinction, although some render both words “treasures” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), while others render both words “treasuries” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). In fact, in many of the references under <em>’otsar</em> it is not easy to determine if the meaning is “treasure” or “treasure storehouse.” In only three places is there specific reference in Hebrew to a “treasure house” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 10:39; Dan 1:2; Mal 3:10</span>).","Where a word for “treasury” is not available, it may be rendered with a descriptive phrase, such as “safe place where the king’s [or, Temple’s] valuables were kept/were guarded.” An alternative model for the last half of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 27:6</span> is “It is against our Law to put it with the money that belongs to the Temple since it is blood money.”","In the New Testament the Greek word <em>gazofulakion</em> also refers to a box in which donations were collected. According to Jewish tradition, there were thirteen such offering boxes in the Temple, and the receptacles that channeled the money down to the boxes were in the form of trumpets or rams’ horns. As a result, the sound of coins falling into the boxes was rather conspicuous. In some cultures such a collection box may be unknown, or at best people know the container that is passed around to collect money in church. If possible, the translation should indicate that the offering box was in a fixed place and not something passed around.

Even a corresponding word for “curtain” could be misleading since it might suggest something that covers a window. Frequently it is necessary to use some kind of descriptive equivalent, for example, “large piece of cloth hanging down from the ceiling” or “large piece of cloth covering the entrance.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:31</span> provides a description of this object. The “veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; Hebrew <em>paroketh</em>) was a “curtain” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), of course, but it is good to distinguish this from the “screen” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; Hebrew <em>masak</em>) at the entrance to the Tabernacle, which was also a curtain (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:36</span> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15.2.3.8 Screen, entrance curtain&lt;REALIA:3.15.2.3.8&gt;</a>). The word <em>masak</em> has the primary meaning of covering something, or even hiding something, while <em>paroketh</em> primarily means making a division and setting something apart. Some translations make no distinction between the two words (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>), but others have “curtain/screen” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “veil/curtain” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “Veil/Screen” (Durham), “screen/covering” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOT</abbr>), and even “curtain/veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). The <em>paroketh</em>, however, was there to separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:33</span>).

From the description of Solomon’s Temple in H01100600600058 we learn that many things were made of wood and then overlaid with gold. Since it was difficult to overlay stone with gold, it was sometimes the practice to cover the stone first with a thin layer of wood paneling or veneer and then overlay the wood with gold. Even though there is no mention of gold overlay in Ezekiel’s description of the future Temple, it has been suggested that such a wood veneer covered the inner stone walls and was itself overlaid with gold. A translator should not, of course, introduce gold where none is mentioned. The phrase <em>schif</em><em>‘ets</em> has been rendered “paneled with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “trimmed in wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), “covered with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>), “framed with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), and “overlaid with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>).","The Hebrew word <em>migra‘ah</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:6</span> describes a structural device in Solomon’s Temple.

Rather than make a hole right through the Temple wall, they made a recess or niche (or narrow ledge) in which the end of the beam sat. This supporting feature is called a <em>migra‘ah</em>.

The most important of these ziggurats are the ones of Ur and of Babylon, dating respectively from the end of the third and the beginning of the second millennium B.C. The ziggurat in Ur is square, measuring 43.3 meters (142 feet) wide by about 62.5 meters (205 feet) long.

As in the case of the ziggurat in Ur, the one in Babylon had three flights of steps—two lateral ones 30.5 meters (100 feet) high and a central one 40 meters (132 feet) high. According to a tablet found in the ruins of the nearby sanctuary of Esagil, it must have had a height of about 91.5 meters (300 feet). The Greek historian Herodotus (<em>Histories</em>, Book I, 181 [185]) describes this ziggurat as being square and having eight levels or “towers” one on top of the other. Like the ziggurat in Ur, it had a shrine near its middle, to which there was access partly by a flight of steps and partly by a ramp.","In most translations it will be sufficient to translate the Hebrew word <em>migdal</em> as “tower” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 11:4; Gen 11:5</span>.

Translating Two Traditions.” The following is extracted from Osborn’s conclusions:","It is fairly clear that there are two different traditions in the book of Exodus concerning the way in which the people of Israel were equipped to move on from their encounter with Yahweh at Mount Sinai. Both traditions describe a portable shrine that would have been necessary for the years of wilderness wandering that lay ahead. Both provide a means for ensuring the presence of Yahweh and the continuing covenant relationship as they begin their journey into the future. But the differences between these traditions may still be recognized in the text as we have it—significant “voices” that need to be heard if we are to understand and appreciate how Yahweh actually did work with these people through succeeding generations.","So I feel that the translator must be sensitive to the voices which can be heard through the text. In the case of the terminology of these traditions, therefore, I would propose the following guidelines:","1) Since both traditions refer to a portable shrine, the terms selected in translation should themselves suggest the idea of a tent or a portable dwelling. It may be possible in many languages to speak of a “tent of meeting” and a “tent of dwelling.” In most contexts, then, the use of the single word “tent” should be adequate, without unnecessary confusion to the reader.","2) In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 33:7; Exod 33:8; Exod 33:9; Exod 33:10; Exod 33:11</span>, it should be clear in the terms used that the tent outside the camp where Moses met with Yahweh from time to time is not the same tent that was constructed with all its parts and equipment in the following chapters.","3) In most cases, where the wider context clearly suggests the elaborate tabernacle, and the immediate context does not include conflicting characteristics of the simple tent of meeting, I see no problem in using a single term referring to the tabernacle. But where there are traces of those earlier voices in the text, there should be a way to preserve them in translation. A last resort would be a footnote giving a literal translation of the Hebrew.","4) In the four cases [<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:7</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 35:10; Exod 35:11</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32; Exod 39:33</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:34; Exod 40:35</span> ] discussed in detail above, however, I feel that every effort should be made to distinguish between “tent of meeting” and “tabernacle.” But if this means that the translation draws too much attention to competing ideas at the expense of a natural flow in the story, then adjustment will be necessary."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.15.1","book":"realia","title":"Tent of Meeting","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹהֶל, מוֹעֵד","transliteration":"’ohel, ’ohel mo‘ed","references":["Exod 33:7","Exod 33:7","Exod 33:7","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:9","Exod 33:9","Exod 33:10","Exod 33:10","Exod 33:11","Num 11:16","Num 11:24","Num 11:26","Num 12:4","Num 12:5","Deut 31:14","Deut 31:14","Deut 31:15","Deut 31:15","Josh 18:1","Josh 19:51","2 Chr 1:3","2 Chr 1:6","2 Chr 1:13","2 Chr 5:5","2 Chr 5:5"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["If Osborn is correct in his conclusion that there were two different tents (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15 Tent of Meeting and Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15&gt;</a>), then the dimensions given in the Pentateuch refer to the Tabernacle, and we have no actual description given for the Tent of Meeting.

decoding=\"async\"></figure>The Hebrew and Greek terms listed above can change in meaning depending on the context. The translator should pay careful attention to the context, which will generally indicate what meaning is in view. For example, the Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> may be used to indicate the entire Tabernacle complex (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:8</span>) or the Tabernacle proper, that is, the tent in the courtyard which contained the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:1</span>). Similarly, the Hebrew word <em>miqdash</em> sometimes means the Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 20:3</span>), sometimes the Most Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 16:33</span>), and sometimes the whole Tabernacle complex (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:8</span>).","The Hebrew word <em>’ohel</em>, which means “tent” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.2 Tent&lt;REALIA:3.2&gt;</a>), can indicate the Tabernacle proper (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:36</span>) or, as explained above (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15 Tent of Meeting and Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15&gt;</a>), the Tent of Meeting.","In some languages “Tabernacle” may be rendered “largest tent in which God lived,” “large tent for worshiping God,” or “holy tent.” In selecting a proper designation, it is important to indicate that the function of the Tabernacle was essentially the same as that of the Temple; there was only a difference of construction and not a difference of use or of religious relevance. Refer to the discussion at 3.14.1 “Jewish Temple.”","Osborn makes the following comments concerning the translation of “Tabernacle”: “A few recent translations have broken from the traditional rendering of ‘tabernacle’ and simply translate it as ‘Dwelling.’ <em>The Translator’s Old Testament</em> (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOT</abbr>) uses the word ‘Shrine,’ which is perhaps a bit more appropriate for what was to become the wilderness dwelling of Yahweh. Either term, of course, could still refer to the tent within the enclosure or to the entire structure including the tent. Both terms suggest, however, something different from the more permanent Temple of Solomon, which seems to have influenced the priestly description of the tabernacle.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32; Exod 40:2; Exod 40:6; Exod 40:29; 1 Chr 6:17</span>: The Hebrew in these verses combines the terms <em>mishkan</em> and <em>’ohel mo‘ed</em>, which <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders “the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.” In the three references in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:0</span>, it is probable that <em>mishkan</em> refers to the inner tent, made of the frames and four coverings, while <em>’ohel mo‘ed</em> refers to the entire Tabernacle complex. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32</span> the two terms are used for the same thing, the second term explaining the first one. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> uses only one expression for both terms in this verse: “the Tent of the LORD’s presence.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> is better with “the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.” Another way to express this is “the sacred tent, where the people met with the LORD.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:2; Heb 9:11; Rev 15:5</span>: These verses speak about a sacred tent, using the same Greek word <em>skēnē</em> that refers to the tent in the wilderness (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:5</span>). However, in these passages the text is speaking of a heavenly or spiritual counterpart (actually, original) of the physical tent. Where possible, the translation should keep the same word to render <em>skēnē</em>, whether it refers to the physical tent or its heavenly counterpart.","The following is adapted from the comments in <em>A Handbook on The Revelation to John</em> (pages 226-227) at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 15:5</span>: There is some uncertainty concerning what is meant by the compound genitive “the temple of the tent of witness” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>). This literal rendering is quite ambiguous, but the average reader probably understands it to mean that in the tent of witness there is a temple. There are three possible meanings for this expression: (1) “the tent of witness” and “the temple” refer to the same thing, so it may be rendered “the temple, that is, the Witness Tent” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>); (2) “the Witness Tent in the Temple” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>, Brazilian common language version); (3) “the sanctuary in the Witness Tent” (so <em>The Translator’s New Testament</em> [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TNT</abbr>], <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, Brc, Phillips [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Phps</abbr>]). In favor of the last interpretation—which is the one that is recommended—is the fact that the word translated “temple” (<em>naos</em> in Greek) is the special term for the inner sanctuary of the Temple, as contrasted with the Temple’s large worship area (<em>hieron</em> in Greek). The inner sanctuary (in which the Covenant Box was kept) was separated by a heavy curtain from the worship area, in which were located the altar of incense and the table on which were placed daily the loaves of bread offered to God. This was also the design of the Tabernacle (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:1–Exod 40:33</span>). It seems best, then, to translate here “the sanctuary [or, most holy place] that was in the Witness Tent” or “… that was in the Tabernacle.” A translation should use here and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 7:44</span> the name for Tabernacle most often used in the Old Testament."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹהֶל, מוֹעֵד","transliteration":"’ohel, ’ohel

In the Tabernacle the Holy Place measured 10 by 20 cubits (5 by 10 meters; 16.5 by 33 feet), while in the Temple it was 20 cubits by 40 cubits (10 by 20 meters; 33 by 66 feet).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In some languages the outer room of the sanctuary may be referred to simply as “the first room of the Tabernacle/Temple” or “the first holy room of the Tabernacle/Temple.” “Holy Place” may also be rendered “taboo place [or, room]” or possibly “restricted place,” meaning that only the priests could enter it.","There may be complications in speaking of the first part of the sanctuary as being the Holy Place, since in some languages the word “place” only indicates a location and not an enclosure. Therefore “the Holy Place” must be rendered in these languages as “the Holy Room.” Other possible renderings are “the Place/Room where God is [present]” and “the Place/Room of God.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 20:3</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “the place where I [the LORD] am worshiped.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 21:23</span>: The use of the plural “my sanctuaries” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) here is surprising and troubling to scholars. Some have suggested that it is evidence of a time when there were several shrines where the Israelites worshiped, but others see it as a reference to “my sanctuary and all its contents” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr>). This interpretation is essentially the one followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> as well as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, and should be adopted in the receptor language. A literal rendering of “my sanctuaries” would be misleading, and the singular “my sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>) does not accurately reflect the text.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 9:1–Heb 9:2</span>: “Sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in verse 1 is literally “holy place” (<em>hagion</em> in Greek). Here it refers to the entire place of worship. It is also called a “tent” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; <em>skēnē</em> in Greek) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:2</span>. A different Greek word (<em>hagia</em>) is used for the Holy Place in 9.2 (literally “holy places”), which is the outer part of the sanctuary. The text is, however, complicated by the fact that the same Greek word for “tent” is used to describe the whole building (8.2), the Holy Place (9.2), and the Most Holy Place (9.3). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> solves the problem by beginning 9.2 with “There was a tent set up with two rooms.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> is similar: “There was a tent which comprised two compartments.” The writer was not interested in the details of any particular sanctuary, but the details that he does give are consistent with a general picture of a large room divided

The general description that follows reflects the opinion of most scholars, and it should be sufficient to assist the translator in his task. The individual parts will be described separately.","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The Tabernacle complex consisted of two main structures. There was an outer wall made of poles and curtains. This defined the borders of the courtyard. Entry into the courtyard was through an opening in the eastern side of the outer wall. The Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> is sometimes used to indicate the entire complex. More often, however, it means the second structure, the large tent that stood inside the enclosed complex. It is for this latter structure that we use the word Tabernacle here.","The Tabernacle was basically a tent spread over a framework. The framework was made of a series of individual frames that were joined together. A frame was made of five pieces of acacia wood. Two long uprights were joined at the top, the middle, and near the bottom by crosspieces or rungs. The ends of the uprights extended below the bottom rung. These two extensions, technically called tenons, fit into corresponding holes in a heavy silver base, which was the same width as the frame. The frames on their bases were set side-by-side, forming a wall. This frame wall was then made stable by inserting bars through three lines of rings that were attached to the frames. There were three such frame walls; the east side had no wall but only an entrance of curtains hung from poles.","The top and sides of the Tabernacle were covered by four layers of different materials. The inner layer, which would have been visible on the inside above and through the openings in the frames, was made of embroidered linen (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.5.3.7 Linen&lt;REALIA:1.5.3.7&gt;</a> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.5.3.11 Embroidered cloth, needlework&lt;REALIA:1.5.3.11&gt;</a>). This layer stretched out over the top of the frame from one side to the other. In this way it formed the ceiling and hung down on both sides to within about 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the ground. Over top of the entire structure were spread three layers intended to protect the frames, the linen curtains, and the implements inside the Tabernacle. While the outer layers were not decorated (except that one was dyed red) and would not have been particularly attractive, they were chosen for their ability to protect against rain, even the relatively small amounts that fall in the Sinai region. Spreading the four layers over the top had the effect of giving the Tabernacle a flat roof, not sloped, and thus it would have resembled a box. The outer layers were longer than the linen layer and hung down to the ground. One end was left open as an entrance.","A number of the objects for the Tabernacle were constructed according to the same basic pattern. For example, the top coverings of the sanctuary were made of two pieces and joined together with a system of hooks and rings. Similarly, the curtain in front of the Most Holy Place was hung on hooks by means of rings sewn into the fabric, and the same method was used to hang the curtains that formed the outer boundary of the courtyard as well as the curtain that closed the entrance to the Holy Place. All of these curtains were held up in the same basic way, by wooden posts that stood in heavy metal bases. Once a translator has determined the proper words to use for ring, hook, post, base, and curtain, the same words should be employed throughout.","Several of the items in the Tabernacle were made of acacia wood (<em>shitah</em> in Hebrew).","Even in languages where there is no particular difficulty in translating the individual parts of the Tabernacle, it will be good to include some kind of illustration or diagram."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.15.2.3.1","book":"realia","title":"Frames, boards","depth":4,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קֶרֶשׁ","transliteration":"qeresh","references":["Exod 26:15","Exod 26:16","Exod 26:16","Exod 26:17","Exod 26:17","Exod 26:18","Exod 26:18","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:20","Exod 26:21","Exod 26:21","Exod 26:22","Exod 26:23","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:26","Exod 26:27","Exod 26:27","Exod 26:28","Exod 26:29","Exod 35:11","Exod 36:20","Exod 36:21","Exod 36:21","Exod 36:22","Exod 36:22","Exod 36:23","Exod 36:23","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:25","Exod 36:26","Exod 36:26","Exod 36:27","Exod 36:28","Exod 36:30","Exod 36:30","Exod 36:31","Exod 36:32","Exod 36:32","Exod 36:33","Exod 36:34","Exod 39:33","Exod 40:18","Num 3:36","Num 4:31","Ezek 27:6"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\" alt=\"UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>These parts of the Tabernacle have traditionally been understood as solid pieces of wood.

A suggestion that is now generally accepted is that the Hebrew word <em>qeresh</em> indicates a kind of “frame” made of wood. The outer dimensions would be the same, but such frames would be lighter, they would make the structure cooler, and they would allow the embroidered inner curtain to be seen on the inside. This suggestion is now included in most modern translations and is recommended here.

Because of these extended meanings, it is important to choose an expression that can, if at all possible, support these additional meanings.","The Greek word <em>xulon</em> is literally “wood.” Outside the New Testament <em>xulon</em> often refers to a gallows; in the New Testament contexts that speak of capital punishment, the reference is to the cross on which Jesus was crucified.

The second Hebrew word, <em>moshkoth</em>, appears only here in Scripture.

(Some of the references are to the creatures themselves, but the places listed above refer to physical representations of those creatures.) The only consistent information given to describe cherubim (the Hebrew plural of <em>kruv</em>) is that they had wings. In some places they have one face, in others four faces. Sometimes they are said to have two legs, at other times four legs. Three-dimensional statues of them were part of the atonement lid that covered the Covenant Box (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1.1 Mercy seat, atonement cover, atonement lid&lt;REALIA:4.1.1&gt;</a> and the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1 Covenant Box, Ark of the Covenant&lt;REALIA:4.1&gt;</a>).

Their wings were extended, with one wing of each meeting a wing of the other in the center of the room.","Representations of cherubim were also embroidered on different cloth items in the Tabernacle. In the Temple, where walls replaced the curtains, similar figures were carved in relief on the walls.","The cherubim serve in Scripture as symbols of God’s majesty and presence.

Translators must not give the impression that the cherub is a variant of some locally known large bird. Even though the cherub’s distinguishing characteristic was the fact of having wings, “winged animal” does not do justice to the composite nature of this ancient symbol. A phrase like “flying being” may be meaningless, and “flying thing” may be equated with anything from an insect to an airplane.

Pagan altars","In the entries that follow, different altars are described. However, in many verses it is uncertain exactly which altar is intended. This is especially true of events in the Tabernacle complex or the Temple, where either the altar for sacrifices or the incense altar may be intended. Many languages have a generic term for an altar or a ceremonial platform that can serve many purposes. Where there is no term for a place of sacrificial offerings, translators may need to use a descriptive phrase or borrow a term.

A number of modern cultures have elevated structures for sacrificing animals or for offering gifts to a deity. Sometimes this will be a stone or wood platform or table. Be sure that the translation makes it clear that the sacrifice is being offered to God.","A descriptive equivalent of “altar” occurs in some languages as “place where gifts are given to God.” Several other models are “place/plat­form/hearth where people offer sacrifices,” “bed/platform for [killing and] offering sacrifices,” and “[hearth] stones for/of sacrificing things.” In some contexts it may be necessary to add a phrase such as “where sacrifices are burned to God” or “where incense is burned to honor God.” Other possible translations include “thing on which [sacred] offerings are placed” and “place of sacrifice.” In most passages the actual form of the altar is not in focus; the important fact is that it was a place where sacrifices were made.","Warning: In some South American languages a transliterated form of “altar” (or its Spanish or Portuguese equivalent) may occur. This word is often “borrowed” with a restricted meaning, sometimes referring to the shrine of a particular saint, or to the front section of a church, or to a patriotic shrine. When a borrowed word of this kind occurs, always check carefully what meaning it has for speakers of the receptor language in order to know whether or not it is suitable.","Similarly, translators may be tempted to use a transliteration of the word “altar” because that is what is used locally in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, or other church. As in the case of the term “priest,” it is recommended that this Christian term not be used as the basis for Old Testament translation, because it has a very different theological significance.

The Hebrew phrase that describes it in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> is <em>ma‘aseh resheth</em>, which is literally “net-work.” The exact position and function of this mesh are disputed. Some scholars have suggested that it was simply wrapped around the bottom half of the altar as a decoration, perhaps also serving to strengthen the wooden frame of the altar; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> a as “cover the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating.” Most, however, understand it as it is described above. Its placement on or in the altar was related in some way to the rim or ledge, which went around the top of the altar (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.2.2 Tabernacle altar&lt;REALIA:4.2.2&gt;</a>).","“So that the net shall extend halfway down the altar” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:5</span> b in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is literally “and the net will be until half of the altar.” This does not indicate whether it means halfway down or “halfway up the altar” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). Most translations have “halfway up,” suggesting that the grating was placed in some way at the lower half of the altar. But <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr> suggest that this grating was near the top. It is probably better for translators to follow this interpretation.","As can be seen from an overview of various translations, it is possible to translate <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 38:4; Exod 38:5</span> and the parallel passage in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4; Exod 27:7</span> without actually leaving the reader with a clear picture of how the grating, rim, and altar were related. While it is true that the functions of the rim and the grating are disputed, a clear description of one feasible option is to be preferred to a rendering that is meaningless to the reader. The following model is given in <em>A Handbook on Exodus</em> (page 635):","4 Make a bronze grating, like a strainer, and attach a bronze ring at each of its four corners. 5 Then place the grating under the rim that goes around the altar, so that it extends halfway down inside the altar.","Another possible model is:","5 Build a rim around the altar near the top, and hang a bronze grating from it extending halfway down inside the altar. At each of the four corners of the grating attach a bronze ring.","<strong>Rings and poles</strong>: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> says that bronze rings were to be put on the “ends” or “edges” of the grating. Verse 7 describes the placing of the poles into “the rings, so that the poles shall be upon the two sides of the altar” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). The Hebrew seems to indicate that there is only one set of rings, those attached to the grating, and that they were used to carry the entire altar. The placement of the rings will depend on the translator’s understanding of the grating as discussed above. If the “grating” is understood as a mesh going around the outside of the altar, then the rings are simply attached to the mesh. If, on the other hand, the “grating” is understood to be horizontal and sitting inside the altar, the rings projected through the corners of the altar so that the poles could be put through them.","The poles were placed into the rings for carrying the altar, and they were probably removed after it had been set into place. Where a language distinguishes between installing an object permanently or temporarily, the latter option is the correct one here.

The comments of Noordtzij (page 144) may be helpful: “The use of censers for the burning of incense here [<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 16:6</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 16:17</span> ] has led some to conclude that this author did not know of the golden altar of incense of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:1–Exod 30:10</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:25–Exod 37:29</span>, but this is based on a misunderstanding. The altar was used for the daily burning of incense in order to close off, as it were, the most holy place from the Holy Place by means of a cloud of incense, so that the proximity of the Lord who dwelled above the ark would not be dangerous to the priests. But the censer was used when the priest (in Israel this was only the high priest!) approached the ark itself (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 16:12; Lev 16:13</span>).” However, see also the comments below at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan&lt;REALIA:4.4.5&gt;</a>.","The incense altar of the Tabernacle was carried by poles inserted through rings attached to its sides (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:4; Exod 30:5</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:27; Exod 37:28</span>). See the discussion at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1 Covenant Box, Ark of the Covenant&lt;REALIA:4.1&gt;</a> above. Unlike the poles used to carry the Covenant Box, the poles for other objects, such as the incense altar, were removed after the piece of furniture was set in its appointed place.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 65:3</span>: The exact meaning of the literal clause “they burn incense on bricks” is not clear. What is clear is that the prophet is speaking against some pagan practice adopted by the people of Israel. Translators may wish to follow <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> by rendering “bricks” as “altars of brick” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> is even more explicit with “pagan altars.” The main point of the prophecy is that the incense was being burned in a forbidden way, in a location other than the incense altar in the Temple.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9; Rev 8:3; Rev 8:5; Rev 9:13; Rev 11:1; Rev 14:18; Rev 16:7</span>: There are eight references to an altar in Revelation, but commentators are divided as to whether John is speaking of the same altar each time and which altar he intends in any given verse. A comment by Mounce (page 157) on <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9</span> is attractive: “It is probably unimportant to conjecture whether the altar is the altar of burnt offering or the altar of incense. The theme of sacrifice would suggest the former, and the prayers which rise (vs. 10) seem to indicate the latter. There is no reason why in John’s vision the two should not blend together as one.” The distinction will be important, however, if a translator has no general word for altar that can retain the ambiguity of Revelation and include both types of altar. Where a translator must choose between a word meaning “altar for burning animal sacrifices” and a word meaning “incense altar,” there are two basic options: 1) choose one of the two words and use it consistently throughout the book, or 2) choose the word according to the context.","In the book of Revelation an altar is first mentioned at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9</span>; however, it is referred to as if both it and its location are already well known, or the author assumes that the readers are aware that they are in a Temple-like setting. This kind of reference should be retained, even though readers of the translation may not yet be acquainted with it. The word chosen should make it clear that this altar is dedicated to God."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מִזְבֵּחַ, מִקְטָר, קְטֹרֶת","transliteration":"mizbeach (miqtar qetoreth)","references":["Exod 30:1","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 39:38","Exod 40:5","Exod 40:26","Lev 4:7","Num 4:11","1 Kgs 6:20","1 Kgs 6:22","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 6:34","1 Chr 28:18","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 26:16","2 Chr 26:19","Ezek 41:22"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מְקַטֶּרֶת","transliteration":"meqatereth","references":["2 Chr 30:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"לְבֵנָה","transliteration":"lvenah","references":["Isa 65:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֻׁלְחָן","transliteration":"shulchan","references":["Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"θυμιατήριον","transliteration":"thumiatērion","references":["Heb 9:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"θυσιαστήριον, θυμίαμα","transliteration":"thusiastērion (tou thumiamatos), thumiama","references":["Luke 1:11","Rev 6:9","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:5","Rev 9:13","Rev 14:18","Rev 16:7","1 Macc 1:21","1 Macc 4:49","1 Macc 4:50","2 Macc 2:5"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 30:1","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 39:38","Exod 40:5","Exod 40:26","Lev 4:7","Num 4:11","1 Kgs 6:20","1 Kgs 6:22","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 6:34","1 Chr 28:18","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 26:16","2 Chr 26:19","Ezek 41:22","2 Chr 30:14","Isa 65:3","Ezek 44:16","Heb 9:4","Luke 1:11","Rev 6:9","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:5","Rev 9:13","Rev 14:18","Rev 16:7","1 Macc 1:21","1 Macc 4:49","1 Macc 4:50","2 Macc 2:5"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.3","book":"realia","title":"Furniture of the Tabernacle and Temple","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.3.1","label":"4.3.1 Tabernacle: Washstand, basin, bowl","text":"4.3.1 Tabernacle: Washstand, basin, bowl"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.2","label":"4.3.2 Temple: Sea, tank","text":"4.3.2 Temple: Sea, tank"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.3","label":"4.3.3 Temple: Movable stand, cart, stand, base","text":"4.3.3 Temple: Movable stand, cart, stand, base"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.4","label":"4.3.4 Lampstand, menorah","text":"4.3.4 Lampstand, menorah"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.5","label":"4.3.5 Table for consecrated bread","text":"4.3.5 Table for consecrated bread"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.6","label":"4.3.6 Tables for preparing sacrificial victims","text":"4.3.6 Tables for preparing sacrificial victims"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Some of the Tabernacle furniture was preserved or duplicated in the Temple built by Solomon.

One problem in understanding <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:39; Ezek 40:40; Ezek 40:41; Ezek 40:42; Ezek 40:43</span> has to do with the number of tables. Most translations understand that there were eight tables altogether, four inside the vestibule and four outside (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “41 Altogether there were eight tables on which the animals to be sacrificed were killed: four inside the room and four out in the courtyard. 42 The four tables in the annex, used to prepare the offerings to be burned whole, were of cut stone …”). However, some understand that there were twelve tables altogether (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “41 So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. 42 There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings …”).","Verse 43 presents the translator with a couple of interrelated problems. The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>shfatayim</em> is not certain. With a small change of its first letter, some versions take it to mean a “ledges/shelves” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). Others understand it to mean “hooks” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>). In addition to its meaning, its location is also problematic. The Hebrew text (in the middle of describing the tables) says it was “inside all around.” If this means all around the tables, it makes little sense (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> “Shelves … were attached all around the inside”). How can we visualize shelves around the inside of the table? <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> simply ignores the word for “inside” and says “Ledges 3 inches wide ran around the edge of the tables.” Some have avoided the problem by assuming that “all around” refers to the walls of the vestibule rather than the tables (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “All around the walls of this room was a three inch shelf”). It is difficult to see the purpose of such a narrow shelf, if indeed it served any purpose at all. Rendering <em>shfatayim</em> as “hooks” solves only part of the problems. The length of 75 millimeters (3 inches) would be reasonable for a hook. The problem of “all around inside” the tables is the same for hooks as it is for shelves. However, if “Hooks were anchored in the wall all around” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>), then we can imagine several possible purposes for such hooks. They could have been used for hanging the work implements, or (as suggested by Jewish tradition) they could have been for hanging the freshly-slaughtered victim while its skin was removed (something that is difficult to do while it lies on a table). The form of the word <em>shfatayim</em> suggests something doubled, so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> has “double-pronged hooks.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֻׁלְחָן","transliteration":"shulchan","references":["Exod 25:23","Exod 25:27","Exod 25:28","Exod 25:30","Exod 26:35","Exod 26:35","Exod 26:35","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:13","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:14","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:16","Exod 39:36","Exod 40:4","Exod 40:22","Exod 40:24","Lev 24:6","Num 3:31","Num 4:7","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","2 Chr 4:8","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 13:11","2 Chr 29:18","Ezek 23:41","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:42","Ezek 40:43","Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16","Mal 1:7","Mal 1:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שְׁפַתַּיִם","transliteration":"shfatayim","references":["Ezek 40:43"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 25:23","Exod 25:27","Exod 25:28","Exod 25:30","Exod 26:35","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:13","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:14","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:16","Exod 39:36","Exod 40:4","Exod 40:22","Exod 40:24","Lev 24:6","Num 3:31","Num 4:7","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 28:16","2 Chr 4:8","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 13:11","2 Chr 29:18","Ezek 23:41","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:42","Ezek 40:43","Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16","Mal 1:7","Mal 1:12"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.4","book":"realia","title":"Tabernacle and Temple implements","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.4.1","label":"4.4.1 Pan, pot, pail","text":"4.4.1 Pan, pot, pail"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.2","label":"4.4.2 Fork","text":"4.4.2 Fork"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.3","label":"4.4.3 Tongs","text":"4.4.3 Tongs"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.4","label":"4.4.4 Basin, bowl","text":"4.4.4 Basin, bowl"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.5","label":"4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan","text":"4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.6","label":"4.4.6 Large shovel, scraper","text":"4.4.6 Large shovel, scraper"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.7","label":"4.4.7 Censer","text":"4.4.7 Censer"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.8","label":"4.4.8 Plate","text":"4.4.8 Plate"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.9","label":"4.4.9 Incense dish","text":"4.4.9 Incense dish"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.10","label":"4.4.10 Jar for the wine offering, libation vessel","text":"4.4.10 Jar for the wine offering, libation vessel"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"The sacrificial cult was a fairly messy business, and the work at the altar required a number of special implements to make things move more efficiently.

The belt was an integral part of the ephod; it was wrapped around the waist and tied either in the front or the back (see also the discussion below). The top of the ephod was at about the bottom of the ribcage. According to a tradition preserved by Josephus (<em>Antiquities</em> III 7, 5), the ephod had a length of one cubit (about 50 centimeters or 20 inches). This would mean that it extended approximately to the middle of the upper leg. The dimensions of the ephod are not given in Scripture.","In order to gain a better picture of the structure of this ephod, it is helpful to consider it together with the breastpiece (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5.5 Sacred pocket, breastpiece&lt;REALIA:4.5.5&gt;</a>). According to one interpretation, the shoulder straps of the ephod were attached in the back and in the front of the ephod, and the breastpiece was attached to these straps in the front by gold rings. This is demonstrated in the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5 High Priest’s clothing&lt;REALIA:4.5&gt;</a>. According to another interpretation, the shoulder straps of the ephod did not reach the belt at the top of the ephod. The space between the end of the straps and the belt (about 25 centimeters or 10 inches) was taken up by the breastpiece. On the four corners of the breastpiece were sewn gold rings. The lower two rings were tied with a blue thread to corresponding rings in the belt of the ephod. The upper rings of the breastpiece were connected to the ends of the shoulder straps by means of small gold chains. On the end of each shoulder strap was a kind of clasp consisting of a precious stone in a gold setting. Engraved on these stones were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. It was to these devices that the other ends of the gold chains were attached. See the illustrations here and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5.5 Sacred pocket, breastpiece&lt;REALIA:4.5.5&gt;</a>.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["“Ephod” is a transliteration of the Hebrew word <em>’efod</em> and is perhaps the most difficult piece of the priestly clothing to translate. In some languages there will be a word for an item of clothing corresponding in design (if not in purpose) to the ephod. However, in some cases the word may not be usable because it designates something used only by women. In other cases a word for a workman’s apron may be inappropriate because its primary purpose is to protect the clothing. This was not the purpose of the ephod, which was the most elaborate and expensive item in the High Priest’s wardrobe. Almost all English versions transliterate <em>’efod</em>, but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr> has simply “apron” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr> translates “[sacred] apron.” In other languages it may be possible to say “priestly apron.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 28:8</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:5</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has the phrase “the skilfully woven band.” This band or belt seems to have been made with the same material as the ephod and attached to its corners so that it could be tied. The use of the singular does not necessarily mean that there was only one belt. The term may have been used in a collective sense. The Hebrew word here simply means “girdle,” “waistband,” or “belt.” The idea of “skilfully woven” is therefore omitted in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> as well as in many non-English versions, and may also be left out of the receptor-language rendering. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> has “The waistband on the <em>ephod</em>.”","<em>Other meanings of ’efod</em>: In a number of the passages listed above, the word <em>’efod</em> describes something other than an item of the High Priest’s clothing. In most (some would say all) cases it still indicates an item of clothing, probably a kind of vest or apron tied around the upper abdomen. See <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:18; 1 Sam 22:18; 2 Sam 6:14</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 15:27</span>, where the Hebrew phrase <em>’efod bad</em> is used; this phrase is literally “linen ephod” or “cloth ephod.” The renderings of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:18</span> (“sacred linen apron”) and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 6:14</span> (“linen cloth around his waist”) may serve as models.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:27</span>: The exact nature of the “ephod” made by Gideon remains uncertain. Because he collected a large quantity of gold before he made it, many have thought it to be a kind of “idol” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, International Children’s Bible, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). However, even here it is possible that a copy of the priestly apron is intended; gold was a major component of the priestly garment, and some of Gideon’s gold could have been used to pay the skilled workers to make the ephod. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “holy vest,” but most versions simply have the transliteration “ephod” (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>). If no explanation is given, however, the average reader will probably associate it with the object of the same name first mentioned in Exodus. It seems best, then, to decide between “idol/image/statue” and “priestly apron”; or, if “ephod” is kept, to include a footnote indicating the possible meanings. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr> note on this verse is a good model: “The <em>ephod</em> may designate here either a receptacle for the sacred lots, used for divination, or the statue of a god.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 17:5; Judg 18:14; Judg 18:18; Judg 18:18; Judg 18:20</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 3:4</span>, the ephods mentioned may well have been sacred clothing similar in purpose and perhaps in form to the ephod of the High Priest. However, both Micah’s ephod in Judges and the one mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 3:4</span> were not the High Priest’ ephod. These ephods are associated in their contexts with illicit worship."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵפֹד, אֲפֻדָּה","transliteration":"’efod, ’afudah","references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:6","Exod 28:8","Exod 28:12","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:25","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:31","Exod 29:5","Exod 29:5","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:2","Exod 39:5","Exod 39:7","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:18","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:22","Lev 8:7","Lev 8:7","Num 34:23","Judg 8:27","Judg 17:5","Judg 18:14","Judg 18:17","Judg 18:18","Judg 18:20","1 Sam 2:18","1 Sam 2:28","1 Sam 14:3","1 Sam 21:10","1 Sam 22:18","1 Sam 23:6","1 Sam 23:9","1 Sam 30:7","1 Sam 30:7","2 Sam 6:14","1 Chr 15:27","Isa 30:22","Hos 3:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἐπωμίς","transliteration":"epōmis","references":["Sir 45:8"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:6","Exod 28:8","Exod 28:12","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:25","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:31","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:2","Exod 39:5","Exod 39:7","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:18","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:22","Lev 8:7","Num 34:23","Judg 8:27","Judg 17:5","Judg 18:14","Judg 18:17","Judg 18:18","Judg 18:20","1 Sam 2:18","1 Sam 2:28","1 Sam 14:3","1 Sam 21:10","1 Sam 22:18","1 Sam 23:6","1 Sam 23:9","1 Sam 30:7","2 Sam 6:14","1 Chr 15:27","Isa 30:22","Hos 3:4","Sir 45:8"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.5.5","book":"realia","title":"Sacred pocket, breastpiece","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֹשֶׁן","transliteration":"choshen","references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:22","Exod 28:23","Exod 28:23","Exod 28:24","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:29","Exod 28:30","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:9","Exod 39:15","Exod 39:16","Exod 39:17","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Lev 8:8","Lev 8:8"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\" alt=\"OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The breastpiece was a piece of embroidered cloth worn by the High Priest over the center of his chest.

While the Hebrew word can include the element of elevation, this is not its primary focus. More important is that it was a site where religious rites and sacrifices—primarily pagan—took place. In most passages where this word occurs, it is best to make explicit that these sites were “places of worship” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) and that they were generally associated with pagan cults. Some translations have rendered <em>bamah</em> as “sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 11:7</span>) or “place of sacrifice” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 11:7</span>). If the context does not make it clear that the text is speaking of pagan sacrifice, then it will be necessary to expand the translation to clarify this. Thus <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> usually adds the word “pagan” or even expands to “high places of pagan cultic worship” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 3:2</span>). Something like this is recommended.","If there is a word in the receptor language for a “shrine” or a place where offerings are placed for fetishes, this may be appropriate. Where such a word is lacking, translators can always say “places where various gods are worshiped.”","In a few passages the word <em>bamah</em> indicates an Israelite place of worship. See, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 9:12; 1 Sam 9:13; 1 Sam 9:14; 1 Sam 9:19; 1 Sam 9:25; 1 Sam 10:5; 1 Sam 10:13; 1 Kgs 3:2; 1 Kgs 3:3; 1 Kgs 3:4</span>. It is significant that these examples come before the dedication of the Temple by Solomon. The later writings of the Old Testament condemn not only pagan worship at the “high places,” but also Israelite worship at any place except the Temple at Jerusalem. In these later books, in fact, “high place” seems to indicate any sanctuary not recognized by the official authorities. Because of this tendency, it is not recommended that one standard translation, such as “pagan places of worship,” be adopted except where the context clearly indicates that this is the case. A translation such as “country temple” for an unauthorized worship place should be avoided, lest readers think that there were temples in the rural areas similar to the Temple in Jerusalem. “Country shrine” may be a good neutral expression, but perhaps the best translation, at least in those passages where unauthorized worship is condemned, is “illegitimate places of worship” or “places where people were not supposed to offer sacrifices.” Translators will normally be able to employ the same word or phrase whether the text is speaking of Israelite or pagan worship."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בָּמָה","transliteration":"bamah","references":["Lev 26:30","Num 33:52","1 Sam 9:12","1 Sam 9:13","1 Sam 9:14","1 Sam 9:19","1 Sam 9:25","1

the burial of the dead. Since much of the land of Israel, especially in the hilly regions, has little topsoil, tombs were often hewn out of bedrock. In some cases natural caves were used for burial. The entrance to a tomb was closed with a stone (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.8.1.1 Stone for closing a tomb&lt;REALIA:4.8.1.1&gt;</a>).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Death is a universal experience, and all languages and cultures have words to express the disposal of a dead body. In a number of languages it is important to distinguish clearly between a grave (a hole in the ground in which a corpse is placed) and a tomb (a construction built above the surface of the ground for housing one or more corpses). In some contexts, however, it may be better to use a more generic expression, for example, “places where people are buried” or “places where corpses are placed.”","In some passages the word “grave” is used as a symbol for death. Translators should consider whether the physical burial place is in focus or rather the fact that a person has died. In the latter case, it may be better to use a term indicating “death.” This will be true especially in poetic passages. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 3:22</span> is literally “who rejoicing unto joy are glad when they find a grave,” but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “They are not happy till they are dead and buried.” <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 5:26</span> is literally “You will come to the grave at an old age,” but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “you will live to a ripe old age.”","Certain verses speak of “graves” in the plural. Here it will often be appropriate to use a word like “graveyard” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:32</span>) or “cemetery.”","In the upper levels of Israelite society burial was often done in two stages. In the first stage the body was either laid on a kind of shelf inside a burial chamber or it was placed in a large box called a sarcophagus (“flesh eater”) in English. After about a year, when the flesh had rotted, the bones were moved to a designated place in the chamber. By New Testament times the bones were being placed into an ossuary (“bone box”). These practices gave rise to two expressions in the Hebrew language: “he lay down with his fathers” and “he was gathered to his fathers.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 16:14</span>, the place where the body was laid out (<em>mishkav</em> in Hebrew) is referred to in the burial of King Asa of Judah. Some translations render the word as “bier” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>; see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.8.4 Bier, coffin&lt;REALIA:4.8.4&gt;</a>), but the structure of the verse indicates that Asa’s body was taken into the tomb and laid in its permanent place, that is, on a shelf in the tomb. The rendering of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> gives the sense better with “resting-place.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 13:6</span>: The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>tsrichim</em> in this verse is uncertain. Some versions understand it to mean “tombs” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">ITCL</abbr>). These would be cave-like structures hewn out of the rock. Others use a more generic term, such as “pits” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) or “vaults” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>). Some have thought this word is related to a Hebrew word meaning “stronghold” or “tower” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:46</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:49</span>, but this meaning does not seem to fit the context here.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 23:29</span> the Greek word <em>mnēmeion</em> may also be understood as referring to monuments built as memorials to people who have died. Here it may be translated “monuments to the dead.” This is also its meaning in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:47</span>. The Latin word <em>monumentum</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">3 Macc 2:16</span> may be understood in the same way.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 5:2</span>  it is important to avoid a term that would designate merely graves, for the demoniac who met Jesus was not living down in graves in the ground, but had found some habitation either in burial caves or in tombs constructed above ground."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בַּיִת","transliteration":"bayith","references":["Isa

In most languages “sackcloth” is described as “coarse cloth” and sometimes as “heavy cloth.” It will often be best to clarify the relation between these clothes and mourning; for example, “clothes that show someone is mourning for the dead.”","In some languages there may exist an equivalent symbol of mourning, such as body painting, smearing ashes over the face or chest, carrying objects such as bags symbolizing a needy widow’s mourning, or wearing a cord of mourning around the neck. There are dangers as well as advantages in such a cultural translation. Particular aspects of the Israelite culture are lost, and there may be undesirable meanings associated with the local practice. Whenever this is done, all of its ramifications should be checked carefully. Generally it will be preferable to use the Israelite custom, with a footnote explaining its meaning or providing the equivalent custom. A footnote might read “Mourning clothes were coarse pieces of cloth sewed together from woven goat or camel hair.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 14:2</span> does not specifically mention sackcloth but speaks of “mourning clothes.” It was the Jewish custom to tear the outer garment as a sign of despair or sadness. However, this verse indicates something more than just tearing the clothing. For the literal clause “put on mourning clothes,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> have “Put on funeral clothes.” Where no special custom is known, or where a known one would be inappropriate for the context of this story, it may be possible to expand this clause to “Go and put on special clothes that will make David think you are sad because someone has died.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 16:15</span>: The first half of this verse is literally “I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). This may suggest that Job will wear the sackcloth permanently, or that he wears it next to his skin. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “I mourn and wear clothes made of sackcloth” avoids expressing either suggestion. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, however, translates “The mourning clothes are my second skin,” which implies that Job will wear them all the time. This line may be rendered “I have put mourning clothes on my body,” “I have dressed myself in the clothes of those who mourn for the dead,” or “I wear the rough cloth of those who are in mourning.”","In some passages the wearing of sackcloth is not an act of mourning because of death but rather an expression of sorrow and penitence. See, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 58:5; Dan 9:3; Jonah 3:6</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 11:21</span>: The last part of this verse is literally “they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; see also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 10:13</span>). Instead of retaining the reference to putting on “sackcloth and ashes,” some translations have said simply “long ago they would have shown to everyone that they were turning from their sins.” However, translators should try to retain these cultural actions in the text, since they were a common aspect of biblical culture."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בֶּגֶד, אֵבֶל","transliteration":"bigdey ’evel","references":["2 Sam 14:2"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שַׂק","transliteration":"saq","references":["Gen 37:34","2 Sam 3:31","2 Sam 21:10","1 Kgs 20:31","1 Kgs 20:32","1 Kgs 21:27","1 Kgs 21:27","2 Kgs 6:30","2 Kgs 19:1","2 Kgs 19:2","1 Chr 21:16","Neh 9:1","Esth 4:1","Esth 4:2","Esth 4:3","Esth 4:4","Job 16:15","Ps 30:12","Ps 35:13","Ps 69:12","Isa 3:24","Isa 15:3","Isa 20:2","Isa 22:12","Isa 37:1","Isa 37:2","Isa 50:3","Isa 58:5","Jer 4:8","Jer 6:26","Jer 48:37","Jer 49:3","Lam 2:10","Ezek 7:18","Ezek 27:31","Dan 9:3","Joel 1:8","Joel 1:13","Amos 8:10","Jonah 3:5","Jonah 3:6","Jonah 3:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"σάκκος","transliteration":"sakkos","references":["Matt 11:21","Luke 10:13","Rev 6:12","Rev 11:3","Jdt 4:10","Jdt 4:11","Jdt 4:12","Jdt 4:14","Jdt 8:5","Jdt 9:1","Jdt 10:3","AddEsth 4:1","AddEsth 4:2","AddEsth 4:3","AddEsth 4:4","Bar 4:20","1 Macc 2:14","1 Macc 3:47","2 Macc 3:19","2 Macc 10:25"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"saccus","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 16:2"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["2 Sam 14:2","Gen 37:34","2 Sam 3:31","2 Sam 21:10","1 Kgs 20:31","1 Kgs 20:32","1 Kgs 21:27","2 Kgs 6:30","2 Kgs 19:1","2 Kgs 19:2","1 Chr 21:16","Neh 9:1","Esth 4:1","Esth 4:2","Esth 4:3","Esth 4:4","Job 16:15","Ps 30:12","Ps 35:13","Ps 69:12","Isa 3:24","Isa 15:3","Isa 20:2","Isa 22:12","Isa 37:1","Isa 37:2","Isa 50:3","Isa 58:5","Jer 4:8","Jer 6:26","Jer 48:37","Jer 49:3","Lam 2:10","Ezek 7:18","Ezek 27:31","Dan 9:3","Joel 1:8","Joel 1:13","Amos 8:10","Jonah 3:5","Jonah 3:6","Jonah 3:8","Matt 11:21","Luke 10:13","Rev 6:12","Rev 11:3","Jdt 4:10","Jdt 4:11","Jdt 4:12","Jdt 4:14","Jdt 8:5","Jdt 9:1","Jdt 10:3","AddEsth 4:1","AddEsth 4:2","AddEsth 4:3","AddEsth 4:4","Bar 4:20","1 Macc 2:14","1 Macc 3:47","2 Macc 3:19","2 Macc 10:25","3 Macc 16:2"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.9","book":"realia","title":"Lots","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.9.1","label":"4.9.1 Urim and Thummim","text":"4.9.1 Urim and Thummim"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"גּוֹרָל","transliteration":"goral","references":["Lev 16:8","Lev 16:8","Lev 16:8","Lev 16:9","Lev 16:10","Num 26:55","Num 26:56","Num 33:54","Num 33:54","Num 34:13","Num 36:2","Num 36:3","Josh 14:2","Josh 15:1","Josh 16:1","Josh 17:1","Josh 17:14","Josh 17:17","Josh 18:6","Josh 18:8","Josh 18:10","Josh 18:11","Josh 18:11","Josh 19:1","Josh 19:10","Josh 19:17","Josh 19:24","Josh 19:32","Josh 19:40","Josh 19:51","Josh 21:4","Josh 21:4","Josh 21:5","Josh 21:6","Josh 21:8","Josh 21:10","Josh 21:20","Josh 21:40","Judg 1:3","Judg 1:3","Judg 20:9","1 Chr 6:39","1 Chr 6:46","1 Chr 6:48","1 Chr 6:50","1 Chr 24:5","1 Chr 24:7","1 Chr 24:31","1 Chr 25:8","1 Chr 25:9","1 Chr 26:13","1 Chr 26:14","1 Chr 26:14","1 Chr 26:14","Neh 10:35","Neh 11:1","Esth 3:7","Esth 9:24","Ps 16:5","Ps 22:19","Ps 125:3","Prov 1:14","Prov 16:33","Prov 18:18","Isa 17:14","Isa 34:17","Isa 57:6","Jer 13:25","Ezek 24:6","Dan 12:13","Joel 4:3","Obad 1:11","Jonah 1:7","Jonah 1:7","Jonah 1:7","Mic 2:5","Nah 3:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κλῆρος","transliteration":"klēros","references":["Matt 27:35","Mark 15:24","Luke 23:34","John 19:24","Acts 1:26","Acts 1:26","Acts 8:21","AddEsth 3:7","AddEsth 3:7","Sir 14:15","Sir 25:19","Sir 37:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"","transliteration":"lagchanō (verb)","references":["Luke 1:9","John 19:24"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Lots were specially marked pebbles, pieces of pottery or sticks used in making decisions.

One form was simply a shallow dish filled with oil with a wick floating in it. Another kind of lamp was about the same size but closed, making it easier to carry without spilling the oil.

It is possible to say “lantern” or “light.” Another good cultural equivalent could be the candle, which works on the same principle as the oil lamp, only with solid fuel rather than oil. Candles were known in the ancient world, although they are not mentioned in the Bible.","As an object whose purpose is to give light, the lamp is sometimes used figuratively in Scripture. All the occurrences of the Hebrew word <em>nir</em> and the Greek word <em>lucerna</em> are figurative. The Hebrew word <em>ner</em> is used figuratively of Israel’s king (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 21:17</span>), God or some something about him, such as his protection, guidance, blessing or word (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 22:29</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:29</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 119:105</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 6:23</span>), life or death as the extinguishing of life (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 18:6</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 132:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 13:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 20:20</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 24:20</span>), the spirit of man (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 20:27</span>), peace or normalcy (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 25:10</span>), and thoroughness (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 1:12</span>).

An example is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 119:105</span>, which <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> renders “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.”","While translators will usually agree that a particular passage is figurative, they may not always agree concerning the exact nature of the figure; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> do not agree about the meaning of the lamp imagery in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:3</span>.

In Old Testament times the normal mill was relatively small and operated by hand. The grain was placed on the stationary bottom stone, and the top stone was pressed down on top of the grain and scraped back and forth to grind the grain into flour. The work of grinding was normally done by women in the early hours of the morning before sunrise. It was hard work and took a lot of time. It is estimated that to produce enough flour to make bread for a family of five, a woman would have needed to grind for over three hours each day.

Some of these mills were relatively small and operated by hand. Others, however, were quite large, and animals were used to rotate the upper stone.","In many parts of the world, grain is ground in one way or another. Quite frequently mills are of the same general structure as those used in ancient times, in which two relatively large, flat stones were placed one on top of the other, and the grain was ground between the two stones.

The choice of an equivalent for these terms relating to “outer garment” will depend largely upon the specific context and the usage in each receptor language. The most common equivalent is usually a term meaning “coat.” In some passages the long robe is culturally significant as an indication of high social status and dignified occupation or activity.","Some Bible passages refer to people tearing their clothes. This was done as an act of grief (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:34; Josh 7:6; 2 Sam 1:11; 2 Sam 3:31; 2 Sam 13:31; 2 Kgs 5:7; Ezra 9:3; Ezra 9:5; Esth 4:1; Job 1:20; Job 2:12</span>). Translators may expand the expression for tearing clothes; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 1:20</span> a <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief,” where the addition of “in grief” makes clear the purpose of the gesture. It is also possible to translate the meaning of the gesture only; for example, “Job stood up full of grief” or “Job got to his feet, his heart broken.” Where there is a common local custom used to display grief, it may be helpful to keep the biblical custom in the text and to compare it to the local custom in a note; for example, the note may read “This is equivalent to the practice of painting the face to show that the person is in mourning.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 3:15</span>: The Hebrew word <em>mitpachath</em> would normally be expected to mean a kind of “veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span>). In this context, however, it is clear that a veil of thin material would not have been strong enough to carry the weight of the barley. Older translations understood it to be a kind of “mantle” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), while modern translations prefer something like “cloak” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Others look for a more modern equivalent, such as “cape” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>) or “shawl” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span>: Sheffer suggests translating the Hebrew word <em>machalatsoth</em> (plural of <em>machalatsah</em>) in this verse as “loincloths.” It is probably better to say “cloaks” or “shawls.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Tim 2:9</span>: The Greek word <em>himatismos</em> in this verse is the general word for garments of any kind, but since women are being referred to, then the word “dresses” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) will fit this context if “dresses” are the natural wear in a translator’s culture. However, in cultures where women wear some other type of clothing, translators should use a more general word, as the Greek

The exact nature of these loincloths is not known, so it may be best to use a general term like “coverings,” or to render the last half of this verse as “and they put leaves together to cover their private parts.” One translation expresses the whole sentence as “So they-two sewed together fig leaves and put them on like a skirt to hide their bare skin.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵזוֹר","transliteration":"’ezor","references":["Job 12:18"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֲגוֹרָה","transliteration":"chagorah","references":["Gen 3:7"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Job 12:18","Gen 3:7"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"6.5","book":"realia","title":"Animal skin","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"עוֹר","transliteration":"‘or","references":["Gen 3:21","Gen 27:16","Exod 22:26","Exod 25:5","Exod 25:5","Exod 26:14","Exod 26:14","Exod 29:14","Exod 34:29","Exod 34:30","Exod 34:35","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:23","Exod 35:23","Exod 36:19","Exod 36:19","Exod 39:34","Exod 39:34","Lev 4:11","Lev 7:8","Lev 8:17","Lev 9:11","Lev 11:32","Lev 13:2","Lev 13:2","Lev 13:3","Lev 13:3","Lev 13:4","Lev 13:4","Lev 13:5","Lev 13:6","Lev 13:7","Lev 13:8","Lev 13:10","Lev 13:11","Lev 13:12","Lev 13:12","Lev 13:18","Lev 13:20","Lev 13:21","Lev 13:22","Lev 13:24","Lev 13:25","Lev 13:26","Lev 13:27","Lev 13:28","Lev 13:30","Lev 13:31","Lev 13:32","Lev 13:34","Lev 13:34","Lev 13:35","Lev 13:36","Lev 13:38","Lev 13:39","Lev 13:39","Lev 13:43","Lev 13:48","Lev 13:48","Lev 13:49","Lev 13:49","Lev 13:51","Lev 13:51","Lev 13:52","Lev 13:53","Lev 13:56","Lev 13:57","Lev 13:58","Lev 13:59","Lev 15:17","Lev 16:27","Num 4:6","Num 4:8","Num 4:10","Num 4:11","Num 4:12","Num 4:14","Num 19:5","Num 31:20","2 Kgs 1:8","Job 2:4","Job 2:4","Job 7:5","Job 10:11","Job 18:13","Job 19:20","Job 19:20","Job 19:26","Job 30:30","Job 40:31","Jer 13:23","Lam 3:4","Lam 4:8","Lam 5:10","Ezek 37:6","Ezek 37:8","Mic 3:2","Mic 3:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δέρμα","transliteration":"derma","references":["Heb 11:37"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"μηλωτή","transliteration":"mēlōtē","references":["Heb 11:37"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\" alt=\"OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The hide or skin of an animal could be tanned or untanned.

Camel saddles could be rather elaborate. Sometimes the saddle was an entire large basket or litter in which a person sat. At other times a wooden frame was placed over the camel’s humped back. Over this frame were draped cloths and blankets to cushion the ride and to separate the rider’s legs from the animal’s back. In either of these arrangements, it would not have been difficult for Rachel to find recesses in which to hide a number of small idols. The text does not say that Rachel is sitting on the camel but rather on the camel’s saddle, and it is clear from the context that she is in her tent. When travelers arrived at their camp for the night, it was the custom to remove the saddle and store it in the tent. If it was a wooden frame, then it also served as a place to sit. The wooden frame, shaped to fit over the camel’s back, created a fairly large hollow area as it sat on the floor of the tent.

fermented drink made from the juice of grapes. The grape harvest season began in the land of Israel around the start of July and went on through the summer. The process of extracting the juice (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.10 Wine press&lt;REALIA:1.1.10&gt;</a>) and fermentation meant that the first wine (the “new wine”) was available in September. Fully fermented wine could be stored for several years, although not as long as is possible today with modern methods of pasteurization and storage. It was common practice to dilute wine with water before drinking it (as much as 50 percent or more). Similarly, wine could also be sweetened with some agent such as honey.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Some people have argued that whenever mention is made of Jesus either making or drinking wine, we must assume that this was only unfermented grape juice. There is no real basis for such a conclusion. Only where “new wine” is mentioned can we assume that this is unfermented grape juice or grape juice in the initial stages of fermentation (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.1.1 New wine&lt;REALIA:9.1.1&gt;</a>).","In a number of languages there is no indigenous term for “wine,” and some expression may simply be borrowed from a dominant language. On the other hand, it is sometimes possible to use a descriptive phrase, for example, “fermented fruit juice.” In some languages the equivalent for “wine” is more specifically “palm wine,” which is a wine made from the sap of certain palm trees. Such a term may also have a more generic meaning and may be applicable to any kind of wine. The term used must be an alcoholic drink (not, for example, simply “grape juice”), otherwise references to its intoxicating power will not make sense.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 27:2</span>: The Hebrew text contains the word <em>chemer</em>, meaning “wine.” However, there has probably been a corruption in the final letter of the word, making the proper reading “pleasant” or “delightful.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:24; 1 Sam 1:14; 1 Sam 25:37</span>: Some translators render the Hebrew word <em>yayin</em> in these verses as “drunkenness.”","The Hebrew words <em>mezeg</em> and <em>mesek</em> indicate a mixture and probably refer to wine that was diluted with water. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 7:3</span> some interpreters and translators understand the meaning to be “spiced wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>). Other translations are “mixed wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>) and “blended wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>).","The Hebrew word <em>nesek</em> literally indicates a liquid poured out. In practice, it was the pouring out of wine as an offering to God or other gods. It will sometimes be possible to translate it simply “wine.” Usually, however, something like “drink offering” is to be preferred.","When juice was pressed from grapes, a certain amount of small solids escaped the filtering process. When the juice stood in containers to ferment into wine, these solids (called in English “dregs” or “lees”) sank to the bottom and even aided in the fermentation process, adding to the quality of the wine. They could be filtered out of the wine before it was served. The Hebrew word for these settled solids is <em>shemer</em>. Depending on the context, it can symbolize the quality of the wine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 25:6</span>), the fact that the wine had not yet been disturbed (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11; Zeph 1:12</span>), or simply what remains at the very bottom of the container (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 75:9</span>). Common-language translations, especially in those places where winemaking is unfamiliar, avoid a literal rendering of <em>shemer</em>. Here are the renderings of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> for the four appearances of <em>shemer</em>: “to the last drop” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 75:9</span>), “the finest wine” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 25:6</span>), “like wine left to settle undisturbed” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11</span>), and “who are self-satisfied and confident” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 1:12</span>).","There are a number of passages in the New Testament where translators must be particularly careful in the selection of terms to render “wine”; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eph 5:18</span> a literal translation of “do not get drunk with wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) could be interpreted to mean that it is permissible for people to get drunk on other types of intoxicating drinks. Therefore it may be necessary in some languages to render this clause simply as “do not get drunk.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 10:34</span> the second and third clauses are literally “he bandaged his wounds, pouring olive oil and wine over [them].” Here it is important to recognize the medicinal value of oil and wine. In some languages translators have indicated the purpose of such an activity by saying “to cleanse and heal his wounds, he poured wine and oil on them and bandaged them.” It may also be helpful to add a footnote about the antiseptic quality of the wine and the value of the oil in the healing process."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֶמֶר","transliteration":"chemer","references":["Deut 32:14","Isa

of ancient times, often appears in Scripture with the more general meaning of “food.” So the expression “to eat bread” means “to eat a meal” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:25; Gen 43:32; Exod 2:20</span>;). Since the bread was not usually cut with a knife but rather broken or torn with the hands, the expression “to break bread” means “to eat” or “to eat a meal” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 16:7; Acts 2:42; Acts 2:46; Acts 20:7</span>).","In many passages the word that indicates one unit of bread is simply “bread,” as, for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 14:17</span>, where the disciples say “All we have here are five loaves [literally ‘five breads’]” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). In many languages it will be more natural to substitute the word “loaf” for “bread.”","The Hebrew word <em>chalah</em> refers to bread of higher quality since it was made with more expensive flour, called <em>soleth</em> in Hebrew (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.1 Plain flour&lt;REALIA:9.4.1&gt;</a> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.2 Fine flour&lt;REALIA:9.4.2&gt;</a>). In some languages it will be possible to make a distinction between this bread and the bread of lower quality.","The Hebrew word <em>kawan</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 7:18</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 44:19</span> refers to bread that was intended not as food but as an offering to a pagan goddess. It may have been shaped like the goddess or marked with her image; translations reflect both possibilities. Similarly, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 13:6; 2 Sam 13:7; 2 Sam 13:8; 2 Sam 13:9; 2 Sam 13:10</span> the Hebrew word <em>lvivah</em> may indicate a special shape (heart-shaped?). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 13:6</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders it “special bread” and adds this footnote: “Or ‘heart-shaped bread’ or ‘dumplings.’ ” Translators are advised to follow this example. The point of the story here is that the “special bread” or “special cake” was something better than average, which could help to revive a sick person or at least cheer him up.","The Hebrew word <em>raqiq</em> refers to very thin bread, perhaps even crisp. It appears most often connected to the Hebrew word <em>matsah</em>, which means “unleavened bread” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.4 Unleavened bread&lt;REALIA:9.4.4&gt;</a>). In these passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:2; Lev 2:4; Lev 7:12; Num 6:15; Num 6:19; 1 Chr 23:29</span>), it will be best to translate it as a unit together with the word for “unleavened bread” (see the suggestions at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.4 Unleavened bread&lt;REALIA:9.4.4&gt;</a>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 16:31</span> the Hebrew word <em>tsapichith</em> probably has about the same meaning.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:2; Lev 7:12; Lev 8:26</span> (following comments adapted from <em>A Handbook on Leviticus</em> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:12</span>, page 95): These verses mention three types of unleavened bread (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> “unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well mixed with oil” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:12</span>) to accompany animal sacrifices: (1) The first type was a perforated loaf made with flour mixed with oil but without yeast. (2) The second type was a kind of thin, round bread also made without yeast, but on which olive oil was spread. It was similar to biscuits or possibly pancakes. It is mistakenly called “wafers” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>. Neither should it be translated “cakes,” which will be misleading in most languages. General terms should be used for these first two types of bread, as long as both terms indicate that they are made without yeast. (3) There is some question about exactly what is meant by the third kind of bread. It was apparently to be similar to the first type, perhaps pierced or perforated, but there is no mention of its being made without yeast and no indication that it was actually baked. This has led some commentators to assume that it was merely a kind of dough made of choice flour and oil. However, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> seems to understand the text to imply both that it was unleavened and that it was baked. Since David shared such loaves with people (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 6:19</span>), it seems best to assume they were baked. And although “unleavened” is not explicitly mentioned for the third type, the contrast with <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:13</span> probably indicates that they were made without yeast. Translators will need to find three different words or descriptive phrases for these three types of unleavened bread.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 6:14</span>: The Hebrew word <em>tufin</em>, which is translated “baked” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and some other English versions, is difficult and uncertain. A number of other translations and commentaries have understood the word to mean “broken” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) or “crumbled” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Still others, following the Septuagint, see it as referring to a kind of pastry (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr>). Translators should probably look for an equivalent to the idea of breaking or crumbling into small pieces. But it may be advisable to add a footnote explaining the uncertainty concerning this term and the different possible translations of it.","The Greek word <em>artos</em> refers to a relatively small and generally round loaf of bread. It was considerably smaller than typical present-day loaves of bread and thus more like “rolls” or “buns.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֲבִתִּים","transliteration":"chavitim","references":["1 Chr

Thus they indicate sacks for carrying grain but also handbags carried by women. Often a generic word for a bag made of pliable material such as cloth or leather will suffice. Translators should, of course, avoid a word that specifically indicates a bag made of plastic or other modern synthetic material. The context will usually help the translator choose between specialized terms, where such exist; for example, the Hebrew word <em>charitim</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 5:23</span> may be rendered “bags” or even “sacks,” while the same word in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span> is better translated “purses” or “handbags.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 42:0</span> – <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 44:0</span> the Hebrew word <em>’amtachath</em> indicates a large bag for carrying grain.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 25:13; Prov 16:11; Mic 6:11</span>: In these verses the Hebrew word <em>kis</em> refers to a bag in which a merchant carried weights. The point of these verses is that business dealings must always be honest, and the fact that the weights were kept in a bag is insignificant. For this reason <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 25:13</span> (literally “You shall not have in your bag a stone and a stone, large and small”) as “Do not cheat when you use weights [and measures].” The same approach is taken for the other two references. It is a good model.","In some passages it will be possible to replace the word “purse” with its contents, “money.” The second line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 16:11</span> is rendered by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> in a similar way, where it has “We will share the booty.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “we’ll all share what we steal.”","The Hebrew word <em>tsror</em> may usually be understood as “bundle,” that is, a wrapping prepared for the occasion and not so much a ready container or bag.","The Greek word <em>zōnē</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:9</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 6:8</span> (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> “belts”) refers to the place where a man usually carried his money. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “pockets” provides a cultural equivalent, and so does <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> with “purses.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> retains “belts,” while Brc says “money-belts.” Some translators will use a general expression, such as “money carriers” or “things where you carry your money.” However, more often this object is dropped altogether; for example, the last clause of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:9</span> may be rendered “carry no money with you.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:10; Mark 6:8; Luke 9:3</span>: In these verses the Greek word <em>pēra</em> is translated many different ways: “beggar’s bag (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “beggar’s knapsack” (Brc), “haversack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>), “pack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “traveling bag” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “knapsack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Phps</abbr>), “bag” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr>), and “wallet” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). The problem is that this word in the New Testament may refer in general to any sort of bag that a traveler may put his things in or it may have the specialized sense of a bag carried by a beggar. As the survey of translations suggests, there is no agreement among scholars. Therefore translators can say either “bag for travelers” or “bag carried by beggars.” Obviously the apostles were to carry nothing with them when they went out."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַמְתַּחַת","transliteration":"’amtachath","references":["Gen 42:27","Gen 42:28","Gen 43:12","Gen 43:18","Gen 43:21","Gen 43:21","Gen 43:22","Gen

The amount of the large debt would be something like the salaries of 1,000 day laborers for 20 years. However, it would be awkward to try to include this information in the translation itself.

While the ancient hearer may have known that a talent was equal to 6000 denarii, this knowledge cannot be assumed for the modern reader. One effective way to emphasize the difference between the two debts may be to convert the 10,000 talents into denarii and render the last half of verse 24 as “one of them was brought in who owed him 60 million denarii.” This will then contrast with the 100 denarii in verse 28.

It is of primary importance to retain the 5:2:1 ratio. Numerous ways have been found in translation to express the amount given to each servant. Here are a few examples for the first half of verse 15: “he handed five thousand coins to the first servant, two thousand to the second, and one thousand to the third” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>); “He gave one man ten thousand dollars, another four thousand dollars, and another two thousand dollars” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>); “He gave one servant five bags of gold, another servant two bags of gold, and a third servant one bag of gold” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>); and “to one he gave five thousand gold coins, to another he gave two thousand, and to another he gave one thousand” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>).","Translations do not agree as to whether the master gave them gold or silver.

However, it may also be used of time, and that meaning is much more satisfactory in the present context. Moreover, the Greek word rendered “span of life” by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> is more frequently used as a measurement of time than height. Modern translations tend to accept the meaning of a measure of time. If span is used as a measurement of time, the use of the word <em>pēchus</em> to qualify it would mean a brief span, whereas if it is used of a person’s height, it would be a significant amount (about half a meter or 18 inches). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> renders the last part of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:27</span> as “add a moment to his life-span,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> has “lengthen his life only by one day.” Other possibilities are “add a little time to his life,” “live a little longer,” and “make his life last even a little longer.” Some translators will indicate a specific amount of time, such as “even one day” or “even one hour.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 21:8</span>: The distance given here is approximately 100 meters or 100 yards.

Some commentators make the point that, for a city that is 1,500 miles tall, a wall only 72 meters (236 feet) tall is so small that it seems foolish. But it is also pointed out that the wall, in this case, is not for the protection of the city (inasmuch as the gates stay open all the time) but for its demarcation. In any case, the notion of height is preferable to that of thickness. A translation should opt for one or the other; simply to say, as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and others say, “a hundred and forty-four cubits” (or, “72 meters” or “236 feet”), without indicating that this is the height, does not qualify as a translation.

Thus, rather than translating “denarius” by some specific amount in a modern currency, it may be equated to a day’s wage. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 6:37</span> the literal expression “two hundred denarii” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is sometimes rendered “the equivalent of 200 days’ wages” or even “eight months of a laborer’s wages.” This will be a good solution in most cases with a couple of exceptions: (1) There are some passages where converting to work days will be unwieldy; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 18:28</span> the debt of the second servant is equivalent to about four months’ wages, which is a figure that people can grasp. However, the debt of the first servant was approximately equivalent to the wages of 1000 men for 20 years. It would be awkward to include this in translation. (2) There are still some cultures in the world where hiring day laborers is unknown because each person or family unit in the village does its own hunting and gathering or even farming. In such cultures “a day’s wage” may have little meaning.","When calculating the number of days’ wages, translators should not forget that, unlike other peoples in the ancient world, Jews did not work one day out of seven. Thus a work week consisted of six work days, and about 25 days made up one work month. The 100 denarii of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 18:28</span> equaled four months’ salary and not three months, as stated in some common-language translations."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δηνάριον","transliteration":"dēnarion","references":["Matt 18:28","Matt 20:2","Matt 20:9","Matt 20:10","Matt 20:13","Matt 22:19","Mark 6:37","Mark 12:15","Mark 14:5","Luke 7:41","Luke 10:35","Luke 20:24","John 6:7","John 12:5","Rev 6:6","Rev 6:6"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Matt 18:28","Matt 20:2","Matt 20:9","Matt 20:10","Matt 20:13","Matt 22:19","Mark 6:37","Mark 12:15","Mark 14:5","Luke 7:41","Luke 10:35","Luke 20:24","John 6:7","John 12:5","Rev 6:6"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"11.6.2.6","book":"realia","title":"Drachma","depth":3,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δραχμή","transliteration":"drachmē","references":["Luke 15:8","Luke 15:8","Luke 15:9","Tob 5:15","2 Macc 4:19","2 Macc 10:20","2 Macc 12:43","1 Esd 3:28"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"The drachma had the same value as the denarius, that is, a day’s wage.

In English “red,” “tall,” “beautiful,” and “important” are adjectives","<strong>AGENT</strong> is one who does the action in a sentence or clause, regardless of whether the grammatical construction is active or passive. In “John hit Bill” (active) and “Bill was hit by John” (passive), the agent in both cases is “John.”","<strong>ALLUSION</strong> is an indirect or general reference to information or to a text that is already well known. For example, when the Preacher in Ecclesiastes says “and the dust returns to the earth” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eccl 12:7</span>), this appears to be an allusion to a passage in Genesis (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 3:19</span>).","<strong>AMBIGUITY</strong> refers to words or sentences that have more than one possible meaning in a given context. For example, in the sentence “Mike said that if Joe comes, he will speak to the president,” “he” could refer to Mike or to Joe. Thus this sentence is AMBIGUOUS. Often what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since intonation and other features of speech help to make the meaning clear. In written discourse, context also helps to indicate which meaning is intended by the author.","<strong>ANACHRONISM (ANACHRONISTIC)</strong> is an expression that is incorrectly used because it is historically or chronologically misplaced. For example, to refer to Jonah buying a ticket for his sea voyage would be an anachronism because it introduces a modern custom into an ancient setting.","The <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong> is a group of books included in the Greek SEPTUAGINT and the Old Testament of the Latin VULGATE but not in the PROTOCANON of the Hebrew canon. See also DEUTEROCANON.","<strong>APPOSITION</strong> is the placing of two expressions together so that they both refer to the same object, event, or concept; for example, “my friend, Mr. Smith.”","<strong>ARAMAIC</strong> is a SEMITIC language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to HEBREW and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.","<strong>ARCHAEOLOGY (ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE)</strong> refers to the study of materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text as well as the people of the days when the text was written.","<strong>ARTICLE</strong> is a grammatical class of words, often obligatory, which indicate whether the word to which it is connected is definite or indefinite. In English the DEFINITE ARTICLE is “the,” and the indefinite article is “a” or “an.”","<strong>ASSONANCE</strong> is the repetition of the same or similar vowels in two or more words in close succession; for example, “A good look at the wool” and “Stick the pin in his fingertip.”","<strong>BORROWING</strong> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been BORROWED by English speakers for “bullfighter.”","<strong>CLASSIFIER</strong> is a term used with another term (often a proper noun) to indicate to what category the latter belongs. “Town” may serve as a classifier in the phrase “town of Bethlehem,” and “river” as a classifier in “river Jordan.”","<strong>CLAUSE</strong> is a grammatical construction, normally consisting of a subject and a predicate.","<strong>COLLECTIVE</strong> describes a group of things (or persons) considered as a whole, such as “rice” or “crowd.” In English a collective noun is considered to be singular or plural, more or less on the basis of traditional usage; for example, “The crowd is [The people are] becoming angry.”","<strong>COMMON-LANGUAGE TRANSLATION</strong> uses language that is widely understood and accepted by most speakers. In such a translation, substandard speech, dialect peculiarities, and highly literary or technical terms are avoided.","<strong>COMPONENTS</strong> are the parts or elements that go together to form the whole of an object. For example, the components of bread are flour, salt, shortening, yeast, and water. The components of the meaning of a term are the elements of meaning that it contains. For example, some of the components of “boy” are “human,” “male,” and “immature.”","<strong>CONNOTE</strong> means to suggest or imply a meaning that is not explicit in the term used. See EXPLICIT.","<strong>CONSONANTS</strong> are speech sounds that are produced by blocking or restricting the passage of air as it comes from the lungs through the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called consonants; for example, “b,” “d,” “f,” “k,” or “m” in English. Consonants were originally the only spoken sounds written in the Hebrew alphabet. Marks for VOWELS were added later above or below the consonants. See also VOWELS.","<strong>CONTEXT</strong> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.","<strong>CULTURAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a kind of translation in which certain details from the culture of the source language are changed because they have no meaning or may even carry a wrong meaning for speakers of the receptor language. Cultural equivalent translation should be used only when absolutely necessary for conveying the intended meaning, and it may be important to add an explanatory note. See CULTURE.","<strong>CULTURE (CULTURAL)</strong> is the combination of beliefs, values, social institutions, customs, and material objects (such as tools or ornaments) of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.","<strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE.</strong> See ARTICLE.","<strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.","<strong>DEUTEROCANON (DEUTEROCANONICAL)</strong> is another term for what is referred to by some as the APOCRYPHA. These are writings that are included in the Greek SEPTUAGINT and the Old Testament of the Latin VULGATE but not in the PROTOCANON of the Hebrew canon.","<strong>DIMINUTIVE</strong> is a word form indicating primarily smallness of size, but also familiarity, endearment, or (in some cases) contempt.","<strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> refers to a translation that tries to give the intended meaning of the source text in a natural and meaningful way so that it produces a response in today’s reader that is essentially equivalent to that of the original reader. LITERAL translations pay more attention to reproducing the forms found in the source text. For example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> follows the Hebrew wording of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 104:29</span> and says: “they die and return to their dust.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> tries to give a dynamic equivalent translation: “they die and rot.”.","<strong>ELLIPSIS</strong> refers to words or phrases normally omitted in a discourse when the sense is perfectly clear without them. In the following sentence, the words within brackets are elliptical: “If [it is] necessary [for me to do so], I will wait up all night.” What is elliptical in one language may need to be expressed in another.","<strong>EMENDATION (EMEND)</strong> is a correction of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.","<strong>EMPHASIS</strong> is the relative importance given to an element in a discourse. Emphasis is conveyed by many different devices, depending on the language; for example, positioning of words, emphatic particles, intensifiers, or ideophones. In “Oh, that you had heeded my commandments!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 48:18</span>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>), the particle “Oh” marks this statement as emphatic.","<strong>EQUIVALENCE (EQUIVALENT)</strong> is a very close similarity in meaning or in form. See DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION and FORMAL TRANSLATION.","<strong>ETYMOLOGY</strong> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.","<strong>EUPHEMISM</strong> is a mild or indirect term used in the place of another term which is felt to be impolite, distasteful, or vulgar; for example, “to pass away” is a euphemism for “to die.”","<strong>EXAGGERATION</strong> is stating more than the speaker or writer knows to be true. Exaggeration may be used to express humor, IRONY, or sarcasm, or to make a particular point. For example, “Everyone is doing it” can mean “Many people are doing it” (implying “and I want to do it, too”). See also HYPERBOLE.","<strong>EXPANDED TRANSLATION, or EXPANSION,</strong> involves translating a single word or short phrase with a longer one in order to introduce information that will give the reader an understanding that is equivalent functionally to that of the original audience.","<strong>EXPLICIT</strong> refers to meaning that is expressed overtly in the words of a discourse. This is in contrast to IMPLICIT information.","<strong>FIGURE, FIGURE OF SPEECH, or FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION</strong> involves the use of words in other than their LITERAL or ordinary sense in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by comparison or association. For example, when the psalmist says “my cup overflows,” he is not saying his cup is too full. He is rather using a figure of speech to say that he is as content as someone who has been served a generous portion. METAPHORS and SIMILES are common figures of speech.","<strong>FOCUS</strong> is the center of attention in a discourse. It may be marked in a special way such as by word order, a special particle, or repetition.","<strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong> is a type of translation in which many features of the source text, especially the form of the discourse, have been literally reproduced in the translation. This approach often results in an unnatural style in the receptor language, or sometimes in the lack of any meaning at all. See LITERAL.","<strong>FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a type of translation that attempts to convey the same set of communicative functions as that of the original source text. Some important functions of communication are to convey information, to express or evoke emotions, to promote changes in thinking or behavior, or to maintain good interpersonal relations. See also DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION, which has a similar meaning.","<strong>GENERAL, or GENERIC,</strong> refers to a general class or kind of object. It contrasts with PARTICULAR and SPECIFIC. For example, the word “food” is a generic term, while “fruit” is more specific. However, the word “fruit” is a generic term for the more specific word “orange.”","<strong>GENITIVE</strong> refers to a grammatical set of forms occurring in many languages, used primarily to indicate that a noun is the modifier of another noun. The genitive often indicates possession, but it may also indicate measure, origin, characteristic, separation, or source; for example, “people of God,” “man of peace,” “pound of flour,” “child’s toy,” or “Garden of Eden.”","<strong>GLOSSARY</strong> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.","<strong>GREEK</strong> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was spoken in the area that is today called Greece. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the SEPTUAGINT.","<strong>HEBREW</strong> is the language in which most of the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the SEMITIC family of languages. By the time of Christ many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language, but spoke ARAMAIC (a language related to Hebrew) or GREEK.","<strong>HYPERBOLE</strong> is a figure of speech that makes use of EXAGGERATION. A deliberate overstatement is made to create a special effect. “He cries night and day” is an example of hyperbole. The statement does not mean that the person cries every moment of the night and day, but that he cries a great deal.","<strong>IDIOM, or IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION,</strong> is a combination of terms whose meanings cannot be understood by adding up the meanings of the parts. “To hang one’s head” is an English idiom. “A drop in the bucket” is an idiom coming from Hebrew (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:15</span>). Idiomatic expressions almost always lose their meaning or convey a wrong meaning when translated literally from one language to another.","<strong>IMMEDIATE CONTEXT</strong> refers to the words that immediately precede or follow a discourse or segment of discourse, and which often help one to interpret the meaning of the whole section. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:2</span> is a passage in the immediate context of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:1</span> and helps to interpret it. See also CONTEXT.","<strong>IMPERATIVE</strong> refers to forms of a verb that indicate commands or requests. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 34:11</span> there are two imperative forms: “Come, you children, listen to me.” Imperatives are often used together with vocative expressions (“you children”). In some languages imperatives occur only in the second person; but in others imperatives also occur in the first and third persons. These are usually expressed in English by the use of “must” or “let”; for example, “They must work harder!” or “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”","<strong>IMPLICIT, or IMPLIED</strong> refers to information which is conveyed by a text, but which is not expressed in words. The speaker assumes that the hearer understands the meaning. Often the meaning is clear from the CONTEXT. For example, when Hannah says in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:6</span> “He brings down to Sheol and raises up,” the implied or implicit meaning is “raises up to life.” See EXPLICIT.","<strong>INTERPRETATION</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct interpretation is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>IRONY</strong> occurs when a person says one thing but means another, often for the purpose of criticism, rebuke, or instruction. When Job says to his friend, “How you have helped him who has no power!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 26:2</span>), he is using irony. He means “You have not helped at all!”","<strong>LITERAL</strong> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a FIGURATIVE meaning. A LITERAL TRANSLATION is one that is very close to the forms and word order of the source language; such a translation is frequently unnatural or awkward in the RECEPTOR LANGUAGE.","<strong>LITURGICAL</strong> refers to liturgy, or public worship, including songs, prayers, responses, and so forth. Liturgical language is often traditional or old-fashioned.","<strong>LOAN WORD</strong> is a foreign word that is used in another language. See BORROWING.","<strong>MANUSCRIPTS</strong> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.","<strong>MARGINAL NOTES</strong> are notes that normally occur on the same page as the text and provide purely objective, factual information of the following types: alternative readings (different forms of the source-language text), alternative renderings (different ways of rendering the source-language text), historical data, and cultural details, all of which may be necessary for a satisfactory understanding of the text.","<strong>METAPHOR</strong> is likening one object, event, or state (the “topic”) to another (the “image”) to which it is not directly or closely related in meaning. For example, when a person says “I am a worm,” he is describing his state as being lowly, miserable, or of no value. Biblical metaphors are often difficult to understand because the basis for the comparison is not always stated, as in the line “The LORD is my rock” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:2</span>). At other times either the image or the basis of comparison is unfamiliar or used differently in the receptor language. For example, when the psalmist says “He remembers that we are dust” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 103:14</span>), he is not referring to the dirt or dust on our bodies. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See SIMILE.","<strong>METONYM</strong> is a figure of speech in which a part of an object is used to indicate the entire object (for example, “one hundred head” means “one hundred cows”), or in which an object stands for another object to which it is related (for example, “the crown” can refer to the king or even the entire royal government)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]}];
