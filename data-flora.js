That duality finds its way into every verse of every chapter of the Bible. The historicity of the text pulls the translator toward formal (word-for-word, sentence-for-sentence) translation. The literary, rhetorical nature of the text pulls the translator toward literary, rhetorical, and poetic equivalence, that is, toward making the same emotive impact on the reader that the original did. That usually requires considerable restructuring and transformation. There is no “happy medium,” only various unhappy ones, or rather, unhappy readers on one side or the other!","Words for trees and plants in the Bible do not escape this dilemma. The first question that a translator must ask is this: Is the immediate context of this word primarily RHETORICAL or primarily NON-RHETORICAL. We say “primarily” here because some texts are difficult to categorize. We say “non-rhetorical” to avoid the word “historical” that carries with it problems of determining what “history” is in the context of ancient texts.","One element of a translator’s task is dealing with technical terms, and particularly whether they should be translated in a way that makes the item familiar to the reader (“domestication”), or leaves the item a bit strange (“foreignization”). A typical example is in measurements. A Bible translator who converts Jewish “cubits” to feet and inches (or to metric units) “domesticates” the text by using measurements that are familiar to the reader, while a translator who leaves “cubits” in the text is (in many cases) “foreignizing” the text. A translator who uses “figi” (from English “fig”) in the text (rather than a local word) is “foreignizing.” The “foreignness” of the whole translation is determined by the accumulation of decisions to domesticate or foreignize measurements, vocabulary, and even grammar, throughout the translation.","The “dynamic/functional equivalence” Bible translation movement in the middle of the twentieth century brought a new thinking, namely, “God speaks your language.” Radical domestication became the norm. But Bible translation theory changes, and right now “foreignization” is not as bad as we used to think. Too much domestication is seen as misleading or even as patronizing, like “baby-talk.” But how much domestication is the right amount? It depends on what the “stakeholders” want. And who are the stakeholders? The publisher, of course, but more important in the long run are the potential readers.","Let us refine the question: How narrow should a translator’s target audience be? Which group of people should be taken as the model for the Bible spellings: rural people with little exposure to other languages? Or cosmopolitan people whose experiences (including radio and television) have been expanded to include a wider range of concepts?","Each magazine or book aims at an audience, who in a sense become the “authority” behind that magazine or book. Bibles are the same. Most European and English Bibles aim at people who are able to handle the “foreignness” of the original Greek and Hebrew technical vocabulary. In this Handbook we try to leave some flexibility in our suggestions for a variety of approaches from foreignizing to domesticating, and for translators in a variety of situations and with a variety of audiences in mind.","To be practical, however, we deliberately attempt to be PRESCRIPTIVE, onerous as that may be to some students of translation. We aim mostly at translators who are doing “dynamic/functional equivalence” translation, with a slant toward taking rhetoric and genre seriously.","Publishers have “style sheets,” recognizing that their set of rules for spelling, format, and style will bring a certain consistency to their many publications, and recognizing also that their set of rules is not universal. Likewise, we promote a consistent approach, and we make no claim that our suggestions for translating Bible terminology are binding on anyone. We can only say that IF a translator follows these suggestions, the result will be within the mainstream of scholarly Bible translation opinion at the beginning of the twenty-first century."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"0.2","book":"flora","title":"References","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["With each entry appears a list of transliterated Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, or Latin words that represent the plant being discussed.

Botanists distinguish “forest” (dense growth) and “woodland” (less dense growth). Hepper states that Lebanon probably had real forests, whereas the Holy Land would have had “woodland” or “open forest,” except for the dense stands of tamarisk and poplar described in Jeremiah as “the jungle of the Jordan.” Large oak woodland once covered the Sharon Plain, while in the mountains fir, pine, cypress, and Grecian juniper grew plentifully. Other trees and shrubs of the upland woods were the cedar, cypress, fir, ivy, laurel, laurustinus, myrtle, oak, pine, and thyine. Some thrived near streams, namely, the plane, oleander, poplar, elm, and willow.","Trees have engaged in a tug-of-war with various forces throughout the centuries. Natural fires have taken their toll, but the biggest enemy has been human. People have systematically cut down forests for firewood, for timber, and for the production of lime and charcoal, right up to the early twentieth century, when the Turks finished off the oaks by burning them as fuel in their trains and by putting a tax on trees, thereby causing people to cut theirs down to avoid the tax!","The trees have occasionally fought back. In the Sharon Plain, after the original Kermes oaks were cut down during the Arab period (800–1400 A.D.), Tabor oaks replaced them. The remains of a wine press or an oil press now standing in the middle of a forest tell us that now and then Nature wins a battle. But the forests and woodlands are losing the war to cultivation and animal husbandry. Sheep and goats are quite effective in preventing the regeneration of trees. Ever-increasing human populations demand more and more cropland. Chemical fertilizers make it impossible for the long process of regeneration even to begin. It is only thanks to the creation of nature preserves here and there that we know what the forests and woodlands of the Holy Land may have looked like centuries ago.","Occurring almost five times as frequently as <em>ya‘ar</em> (“forest”), the Hebrew word <em>midbar</em> (“wilderness” or “desert”) appears over 270 times in the Old Testament. The majority of these references are found in the Pentateuch, where the saga of the “wilderness experience” of the Israelites unfolds. Subsequent references to <em>midbar</em> often recall the great exodus from Egypt and the wanderings of the descendants of Jacob in Sinai. In those long years they became familiar with many desert species that are now recorded for us in the Bible, species like acacia, broom, boxthorn, date palm, juniper, tamarisk, terebinth, and styrax. They would also have known many others that are not recorded in Scripture. After the conquest of Canaan, the southern part of the country, called <em>Negev</em> (“dry”), became synonymous with “desert.” The Jews who settled there knew its plants and depended on them.","In this chapter we deal with twenty-six trees and shrubs that grew in the uncultivated areas of the Holy Land. The forest, streamside, and desert trees have been mentioned above. We include here two others that were imported from elsewhere, namely ebony from Africa and sandalwood from India.","In at least half of the cases, botanists agree on the identification of the wild trees. The conifers (pine, fir, cypress, cedar) are a particular problem, and debate continues to the present. Following Zohary and others, we propose that the Hebrew word <em>berosh</em> be taken as a generic word covering the Cilician fir, the Grecian juniper, and the cypress. Likewise, there is considerable uncertainty about the streamside trees and about styrax."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"1.1","book":"flora","title":"Acacia","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שִׁטָּה","transliteration":"shittah","references":["Exod 25:5","Exod 25:10","Exod 25:13","Exod 25:23","Exod 25:28","Exod 26:15","Exod 26:26","Exod 26:32","Exod 26:37","Exod 27:1","Exod 27:6","Exod 30:1","Exod 30:5","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:24","Exod 36:20","Exod 36:31","Exod 36:36","Exod 37:1","Exod 37:4","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 37:28","Exod 38:1","Exod 38:6","Deut 10:3","Isa 41:19"],"strongs":["H7848"]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0001_acacia\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0001_acacia.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0001_acacia\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Acacia — Acacia shrub</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">© Ray Pritz by United Bible Societies</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/PRITZ/PTZ-0001_acacia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>The plural form of <em>shittah</em> (<em>shittim</em>) is used sometimes as a place name (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 25:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 33:49</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 3:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 5:2</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 4:18</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:5</span>), which is evidence of the wide distribution of this tree in Sinai and southern Palestine.

A third variety (<em>Acacia albida</em>) is found in lowland Israel, the Sharon Plain, and lower Galilee. The common acacia was the only tree available to the Israelites for construction of the Tabernacle. Hareuveni discusses the problem of getting enough acacia trees in the wilderness for all the Tabernacle furniture including the 15 meter (50 foot) pole that ran the length of the side wall. He assures us that although most acacias are smaller, there are some that reached 15 meters in height. But would there be a piece straight enough even in a 15 meter acacia to use as a side pole? I doubt it. Then again, they could have joined short pieces to make a long one. Indeed, a collapsable pole would have made transport easier.

Likewise, the German <em>Ginsterstrauch</em> in the German common language version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>) is not well known. Hence, some modern versions use a generic term in 1 Kings, such as “large bush” (Contemporary English Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> ]), “tree” (Good News Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> ], and “bush” (New Century Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> ]). In areas where plants are still known by species names, translators can select a shrub that grows in dry, barren areas (assuming it is big enough to offer shade), or transliterate from the Hebrew (<em>rothem</em>) or a major language (for example, <em>retem</em> in Arabic). Otherwise, they can use “small tree” or “shrub.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 120:4</span> a local kind of wood that produces a very hot fire could be used, since the text is rhetorical, and needs an image of something very hot.","The reference to broom in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 30:4</span> poses major textual and exegetical problems, which explains the variety of renderings in modern Bibles. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> reads “they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes, and to warm themselves the roots of the broom.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and the New International Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) have these poor folk <em>eating</em> the roots of the broom tree. However, reliable sources tell us that the root of the broom tree is poisonous. That is why Moldenke suggested that it must be another plant, namely the parasite Dog’s Club <em>Cynomorium coccineum</em>, which grows up out of the roots of the broom tree. However, there is good evidence that the writer intended to say the roots were “burned” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), not “eaten” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>). Hanni Kuhn, writing in <em>The Bible Translator</em>, advises three options for translators of the two difficult lines of this verse, two of which we put forward here (the third, following Moldenke’s suggestion of dog’s club, has had less support and we are not promoting it):","1. They pluck saltplant [orache] leaves for food,","the roots of broom they burn for warmth.","Here the letters <em>l-ch-m-m</em> of the final Hebrew word are read as <em>lchumam</em> (“to warm themselves”). This is followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and Moffatt (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>), based on a change in the vowels that were added to the Hebrew text. (For “saltplant,” see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:3.5.10\">3.5.10 Orache (saltwort)</a>)","2. They pluck saltplant leaves to eat,","and sell/make embers/coals [charcoal] of broom to earn their bread.","In this rendering <em>l-ch-m-m</em> is read as <em>lachmam</em> (“their bread/food”).

This is implausible, even though enthusiastically promoted by the staff of the St. Catherine’s monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai, where a specimen of <em>Rubus sanguineus</em> has been planted. Apart from this individual plant, there is no evidence that any species of <em>Rubus</em> has ever grown in Sinai or even in southern Israel.

He also argues against the <em>Acacia nilotica</em> as a candidate because that has never grown in Sinai. Other possibilities are that the bush was a hawthorn (which has red fruits) or an acacia shrub that had a red-flowered parasite growing on it. Hepper states that it is impossible to tell.

Now only a few pockets of these mighty cedars remain. At that time they were mixed, as they are today, with other trees such as Cilician fir, Grecian juniper, cypress, and Calabrian pine.","We know from 1 Kings that Solomon used cedar wood in his palace and in the Temple. Cedar was used for beams, boards, pillars, and ceilings. Historians tell us that the Assyrians also hauled cedars to their land for use in buildings.

In sub-Saharan Africa, translators can transliterate from Hebrew (<em>erets</em>), Greek (<em>kedar</em>), English (<em>sedar</em>), or another major language, or they can take a generic solution such as “large, beautiful tree.” In poetic passages (wisdom literature and prophecy), some translators may wish to use a cultural equivalent with these traits. In Africa, according to Burkhill, the Pink Mahogany <em>Guarea cedrata</em> is also called the pink African cedar because of the cedar-like scent of its timber. Likewise, some people in India and Australia use “cedar” to refer to the toon because of its reddish wood. I do not recommend such substitutes in historical passages, since the <em>’erez</em> is not related to these trees.

In the few other places where it occurs, it may refer to any one of the three conifers. The logic here is that since cypresses grew in Judea, King Solomon would not need to import them from Lebanon. However, it could also be argued that Lebanon may have produced better specimens than King Solomon could find in Israel and he might have imported some of them. In either case, this does not argue against <em>berosh</em> as a generic term.","Hepper appears to agree with Zohary. Hareuveni identifies <em>berosh</em> as juniper. Thus, if <em>berosh</em> does refer to a single species, current scholarly opinion would support “fir” or “juniper,” but not “cypress” or “pine.” It is quite possible that <em>berosh</em> and its cognates <em>burasu</em> (Akkadian) and <em>brotha</em> (Lebanese Arabic) have been used at different times both as generic terms and as specific terms for one of the conifers.","Regarding the <em>gofer</em> wood that Noah used for his ark (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 6:14</span>), little can be known until actual specimens turn up on Mount Ararat.

The majority of English versions (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>) transliterate directly from the Hebrew in both books, but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> harmonize 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles by using “juniper” throughout. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> likewise avoids the issue by translating “precious wood” in both books. The debate hinges on two questions:","1. Is <em>’almug</em> in 1 Kings the same as <em>’algum</em> in 2 Chronicles?","2. Where does the <em>’almug</em> /<em>’algum</em> tree come from?","Note where they are said to come from: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11</span>, <em>’almug</em> from Ophir; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span>, <em>’algum</em> from Lebanon; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span>, <em>’algum</em> from Ophir.","The botanical commentators stand as follows: Zohary, following Tristram, says that the trees are the same, that is, red sandalwood (<em>Pterocarpus santolinus</em>, also called red saunders) from India (via Ophir). Hepper, following Moldenke, Celsius, W. Smith and others, says the trees are different: <em>’almug</em> is the red sandalwood; <em>’algum</em> is the Grecian Juniper <em>Juniperus excelsa</em> of Lebanon.","According to <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FFB</abbr>, the trees are the same, of unknown origin but maybe the red sandalwood, the white sandalwood, or the Phoenician juniper.","The biblical commentators Keil and Delitzsch consider the trees to be the same, namely sandalwood. According to them, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:8</span> the writer mistakenly groups <em>’algum</em> with cedar and cypress as products of Lebanon, whereas <em>’algum</em> should stand separately with “precious stones,” as it does in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span>. Furthermore, G. H. Jones argues it should be <em>’almug</em>, not <em>’algum</em>, on the basis of cognates in Ugaritic (<em>’-l-m-g</em>) and Akkadian (<em>elammakku</em>). Furthermore, a dialect of Sanskrit has the word <em>mocha</em> for the sandalwood tree (see also the appendix below). Adding the Arabic definite article <em>al</em> could explain <em>al-mug</em> (and Arabic typically changes <em>o</em> to <em>u</em> in loan words). Greenfield and Mayrhofer (1967, quoted in Hepper) also hold on philological grounds that <em>’algum</em> and <em>’almug</em> are the same thing; they identify it with a tree from Lebanon which they do not name. Ugaritic records, incidentally, refer to a tree called <em>’-l-m-g</em>.","On a quite different track, Hareuveni (page 99) tries to make a case for translating <em>’almug</em> as “coral,” a mineral product found in the sea, on the ground that <em>’almog</em> is the modern Hebrew word for coral. It makes a good pair with “precious stones.” Hareuveni quotes the Babylonian Talmud, which describes in detail how these “coral trees” are brought up from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.","The translators of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> (following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FFB</abbr>, which follows Koehler and Baumgartner) hold that the phrase “<em>’algum</em> from Lebanon” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> is basic and that it must refer to the Phoenician juniper (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.11.2\">1.11.2 Phoenician juniper (coastal juniper)</a>). Then they harmonize 1 Kings with 2 Chronicles.","Looking at the accounts in 1 Kgs 10 and 2 Chr 9 as stories about Hiram’s contribution to King Solomon, one may observe first of all that the accounts are both awkwardly interrupted by the story of the visit of the queen of Sheba.* They are almost word-for-word parallels except for the <em>’almug</em> /<em>’algum</em> difference. King Hiram brought gold from Ophir, and also, incidentally, <em>’algum</em> /<em>’almug</em> wood and precious stones. 1 Kings refers to <em>’almug</em> three times; the parallel account in 2 Chronicles mentions <em>’algum</em> twice, with the third parallel clearly implied. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that they refer to the same product, and that the variation is caused by the simple inversion of the two Hebrew consonants <em>mem</em> and <em>gimel</em> in one account. Neither account says where the wood came from, but it seems not to be Lebanon. This seems to rule out “juniper” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>). And it may not be Ophir. Which of the two readings is earlier? It is generally accepted that the Kings account came first and that the Chronicler used the Deuteronomic Kings account (with <em>’almug</em>) as a reference. Let us assume that <em>’almug</em> is prior.","Note that <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> (8) expresses King Solomon’s desire that King Hiram send him “cedar, cypress and <em>’algum</em>.” There is no exact parallel to this in 1 Kings, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:7; 1 Kgs 5:8; 1 Kgs 5:9</span> we have King Hiram’s response to Solomon’s request. He says that he will send Solomon cedar and cypress. There is no reference to any other type of wood. But when we get to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> we find that Hiram sends algum wood and precious stones. We can conclude that <em>’algum</em> was added to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> in order to anticipate the statement in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> (and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11</span>) that Solomon brought <em>’algum</em> wood for use in the Temple. Unfortunately, the way it was added makes it sound as though the precious wood is from Lebanon. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 8:18</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> (interrupted by the queen of Sheba story) clearly separate the gold (from Ophir) from the algum and precious stones (origin unspecified). We conclude that, in adapting the text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11; 1 Kgs 10:12</span>, the scribe preparing <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10; 2 Chr 9:11</span> inverted the consonants, yielding <em>’algum</em>, and the other reference in 2 Chronicles was adapted to harmonize with the first."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The Red Sandalwood <em>Pterocarpus santolinus</em> is a large tropical tree with hard, reddish wood and yellow flowers.

This assumes that the Arabs were trafficking in sandalwood, using the name <em>almuka</em> or something like it, and that the Arabic word came into the Hebrew Bible at the time of the writing of 1–2 Kings and 1–2 Chronicles. There is a question, however, whether the definite article was in use in Arabic at the time these books were written. Moscati’s <em>An Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages</em> says that most texts of Epigraphic South Arabian and Early Northern Arabic (fifth century <abbr class=\"bible-version\">B.C.</abbr> to fourth century <abbr class=\"bible-version\">A.D.</abbr>) have no definite article, but instead suffix a <em>nun</em> or <em>mem</em> for the absolute state (as in Babylonian).

We now turn to trees and shrubs that were cultivated. In some cases it is difficult to know when a particular species was actually domesticated, since the process took place over centuries and much of it happened outside our area of study. Date palms, olives, and figs were probably cultivated quite early, as they could be grown from cuttings. Thirteen domestic trees are mentioned in the Bible, although in some cases, such as apple, carob, pistachio, citron and walnut, there is much debate about their identity in a particular passage. In any case, the species mentioned here were unquestionably grown in Israel in Bible times.","Despite its importance to the survival of human beings, agriculture in the Near East has devastated the original vegetation. Humans, with their tools (including fire) and grazing animals, have decimated the forest and other plant life to the point where almost none of it survives except in protected areas. Even the desert has been damaged by the removal of shrubs, leaving the slopes to be eroded down to the bare rock.","On the other hand, the vegetation of the land—both wild and cultivated—has also had a profound effect on the human beings who lived there. At the time of the conquest of Canaan, the scouts discovered a “land flowing with milk and honey.” They brought back with them figs and pomegranates and a cluster of grapes so huge it took two of them to carry it on a pole between them. When the conquest finally took place, the newcomers took over a well-developed agriculture that they then developed to a higher level, bringing in plants from Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and other countries.","The effect of agriculture, and particularly of trees, was not just a matter of producing food. The vocabulary of agriculture saturates the language and literature of the Holy Land. Apart from the emotional associations carried by trees such as cedars, oaks, palms, olives and vines, the images of seed, fruit, flower, root, and harvest occur as metaphors over and over in the language of the prophets and in the Wisdom literature, right through to the teachings of Jesus and his followers.","Regarding the translation of names for cultivated trees, our general strategy is that when a tree or shrub is used rhetorically, that is, as a metaphor or simile, then the focus is on the <em>quality</em> of the tree or shrub, not on the botanical details. In that case the translator is urged to find a cultural equivalent carrying that same quality. When the passage is not rhetorical, the translator is compelled by the historicity of the passage to find a botanically related species. When that is not available, it becomes necessary to use a transliteration from a major international language, seek a generic word, or use a descriptive phrase. There is a loss in that, of course. Translation is a matter of balancing losses and gains.","We are including the carob and citron here even though they could as well be treated under “1 Wild Trees and Shrubs.”"]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.1","book":"flora","title":"Almond","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"לוּז","transliteration":"luz","references":["Gen 30:37"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מְשֻׁקָּד","transliteration":"meshuqad","references":["Exod 25:33","Exod 25:33","Exod 25:34","Exod 37:19","Exod 37:19","Exod 37:20"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שָׁקֵד","transliteration":"shaqed","references":["Gen 43:11","Num 17:23","Eccl 12:5","Jer 1:11"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0002_almond_flower\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0002_almond_flower.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0002_almond_flower\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Almond — White flowers of the sweet almond tree</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">© Ray Pritz by United Bible Societies</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/PRITZ/PTZ-0002_almond_flower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>The almond is one of a group of fruit-bearing trees (<em>Prunus</em>) that also includes plums, cherries, peaches, and apricots.

The trees in this family are legumes, that is, they put nitrogen into the soil by way of little nodules on the roots. As the tree ages, the trunk becomes twisted. In contrast to many other trees of the Bible lands, this one bears flowers in autumn, and the seed pods form the following summer.

In the latter case there is a legitimate question of where they got the leaves, since Jerusalem is rather too high and cold for date palms. But the same could be asked about the prophetess Deborah’s palm (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 4:5</span>), which was located between Ramah and Bethel, scarcely lower than Jerusalem. Jericho was known as the “city of palm trees” (<em>temarim</em> in Hebrew - <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 34:3; Judg 1:16; Judg 3:13; 2 Chr 28:15</span>).

The leaves were and are used for mats, baskets, fences, and roofs. Date palms are now cultivated intensively in the Jordan and Aravah valleys, around the Dead Sea, and on the coastal plain of Israel.

Inside the soft fruit is a very hard seed about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long. Date palm trees are either male or female, and there are places where the trees of one sex grow but no fruit is seen, because they lack pollination. Farmers prefer to propagate them by cultivating the suckers that grow at the base of the tree, rather than from seeds, which would produce too many male trees.

I am not aware of a non-European language that has a generic word for palm. Since the function of palm branches in the Festival of Shelters is to build rough shelters, the type of palm tree does not make a lot of difference. The same is true for references where the image of the palm is used as a decoration, as in the description of the Temple (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:29; 1 Kgs 6:35</span>). In cases where the fruit is mentioned, a transliteration is recommended, either from the Hebrew word <em>tamar</em> or from a major language.","In locations where oil and coconut palm trees are found, but no date palms, the oil palm is to be preferred. In places where no palms are found, it is still possible that the date fruit is found in markets, particularly in Muslim-dominated areas, where it may be a popular item for breaking the fast during Ramadan. In northern Nigeria, a dwarf species of date palm (<em>Phoenix reclinata</em>) grows in ravines and bears small edible fruits much like the big palm. At least one translation there (Berom) makes use of the local name.","It would seem then that if the date palm is not known at all, the options here are:","1. use the word for oil or coconut palm (and consider writing a footnote that indicates that the Hebrew words <em>tamar</em> and <em>tomer</em> and the Greek word <em>phoinix</em> refer to a similar tree that has a quite different fruit);","2. transliterate from Hebrew (<em>tomera</em>, <em>tamara</em>) and Greek (<em>fonis</em>, <em>fowinik</em>);","3. transliterate from a major language, for example, <em>nakhal</em> /<em>temer</em> (Arabic), <em>dattier</em> (French), <em>datil</em> /<em>palmera</em> (Spanish), <em>mtende</em> (Swahili), <em>khaji</em> (Hindi), <em>karchuram</em> (Tamil), and <em>haizao</em> (Chinese);","4. use a generic phrase appropriate to the context, for example, “beautiful tree.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 24:6</span>: The first line of this verse reads “Like valleys [<em>nechalim</em>, plural of <em>nachal</em> ] that stretch afar.” The Hebrew word <em>nachal</em> refers literally to a “torrent” of water. Since that makes an odd parallel with gardens, aloes, and cedars, the majority of scholars believe it refers to date palms here based on a similar word in Arabic with that meaning. Many English versions have “palm groves” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>; similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>) or “rows of palms” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 15:32</span>: The Hebrew words <em>temurato</em> (“his recompense”) in verse 31 and <em>timmale'</em> (“It will be paid in full”) in verse 32 have been debated for centuries.

This interpretation anticipates the Hebrew word <em>kipah</em> (“branch”) in verse 32, where the second line reads “and his branch will not be green.” Dhorme suggests that <em>temurato</em> should be read as <em>zemorato</em> (“his vine shoots”), which anticipates the line about grapevines in verse 33. <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em> supports using “palm tree” and “palm branch” in this passage. We do too.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:18</span>: Instead of “sand,” the Septuagint reads “palm tree” (<em>phoinix</em>).

data-target=\"FLORA:2.12\">2.12 Vine</a>). They are closely related. The common fig tree grows not only in Israel, but throughout the world in warm climates. In the Holy Land it was a common source of food; the fruit was eaten both fresh and dried. Sometimes the dried ones were pressed together to form flat “cakes” or blocks (Hebrew <em>develah</em>). But, just as important, the large leaves of the fig make it an excellent shade tree. However, the first use of the fig mentioned in the Bible (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 3:7</span>) was not for food or shade but for clothing; Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves for themselves to cover their nakedness.","The fig was probably domesticated in northwestern Turkey from a wild variety that grew there around 5000 years ago. Greek, Roman, and Egyptian records indicate that the fruits were popular. Figs are now grown especially in Israel, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Portugal, as well as in the warm parts of the United States. The fig is distantly related to the mulberry (<em>Morus nigra</em>), breadfruit (<em>Artocarpus altilis</em>), jackfruit (<em>Artocarpus heterophyllus</em>), and Chinese mulberry (<em>Cudrania tricuspidata</em>).","The fig is believed to be indigenous to western Asia and to have been distributed by humans and birds throughout the Mediterranean area.

The trunk may grow to be more than 70 centimeters (2 feet) thick. Fig trees may grow to be several decades old, if they are well cared for. Figs are usually propagated by planting cuttings. The pollination of the flowers is an amazingly intricate process closely linked to the life cycle of a tiny wasp, and the fact that fig trees, like papayas and date palms, are male or female. (There are now some kinds of figs that produce fruit without pollination.) The fruits are about the size of a hen’s egg and can be green, yellow, purple, or brown depending on the type. They are sweet and soft and difficult to transport. For that reason most farmers dry the fruits before shipping them. The “fruit” of the fig is technically a strangely shaped flower.

It is common as a snack in northern Nigeria. The “Chinese olive” is also a species of <em>Canarium</em> and may be a possible cultural substitute, if it produces edible fruit and oil. The “Russian olive” grown in dry regions of the world is a member of the <em>Elaeagnus</em> family and not a true olive. A variety of olive (<em>Olea cuspidate</em>) is used for building in India and Nepal, but it is probably not possible to use it in the Bible except perhaps in a study Bible where you could say that the biblical olive was related to this tree.","Since most of the kinds of olive trees in the world do not have edible fruit, it may not be possible to substitute a local variety.

The word <em>pome</em> simply means “fruit,” so the basic word to transliterate from is <em>granate</em> (compare <em>granada</em> in Spanish). A possible expression is “garinada fruit.” The Latin phrase <em>Punica granatum</em> for pomegranate means the “grenade” of Punica (= Carthage), a city in present-day Tunisia. The Latin word <em>granatum</em> means “filled with many grains or seeds.” Reflecting this, Bambara of Guinea uses “karanati fruit.” One could also use the Hebrew <em>rimmon</em> as a base. Areas influenced by Arabic may find a word like <em>rummân</em>, for example, <em>roomaanoo</em> in Mandinka. A footnote could describe the fruit as similar to a guava, red and seedy.","Although the pomegranate has been introduced recently throughout Africa, it is not well-known, so the name will most likely need to be transliterated. As the English name is quite long, the translator is advised to translate from another source or look for ways to shorten it, such as “granata fruit.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 28:33</span>: “On its skirts you shall make pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet stuff, around its skirts, with bells of gold between them.” Here the writer is talking about making images of pomegranate fruit from cloth (“blue and purple and scarlet stuff”). One could say something like “… take colored string [or, cotton] and make things like pomegranate fruit … .” Also consider using an illustration. Finally, one could consider using “like the fruit of trees” in the text, and designating the species (pomegranate) in a footnote. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr> takes the pomegranates as embroidered, but the impression is given that the bells are also embroidered, which seems odd, as they need to tinkle (verse 35). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “balls like pomegranates,” which is clear.

It is possible that this refers to the practice of making a cut in the immature fruit, which has the effect of accelerating the growth of the fruit. Hepper (page 113) reports that this sudden growth is caused by ethylene gas released when the fruit is cut. Incidentally, today ethylene gas is used by fruit sellers to hasten the ripening of oranges and bananas."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0852_sycomore_fig\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0852_sycomore_fig.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0852_sycomore_fig\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Sycomore fig — Sycomore figs on trunk of tree</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PikiWiki_Israel_20284_Plants_of_Israel.JPG • © udi Steinwell, PikiWiki Israel, CC BY 2.5, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0852_sycomore_fig.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>The sycomore fig is not a tall tree (up to 10 meters [33 feet]) but has large low, spreading branches—just right for a short man to climb up in order to see over a crowd of taller people (see the story of Zacchaeus in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 19:4</span>).

It grows along the ground until it finds a tree or other object to climb, using tendrils. It bears bunches of small round fruit that are sweet and juicy. Today farmers grow them commercially throughout the Mediterranean area, in South Africa, in North America, and in many other countries. The first reference to the vine in the Bible (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:20</span>) tells us that Noah planted a vineyard (Hebrew <em>kerem</em>) and that he made an alcoholic drink from the fruit. Farmers since then have improved on the size, color, and quality of the fruit by careful pruning and selection until now there are at least 65 kinds of grapevines. Like many other plants in temperate areas, the vine has leaves that appear in early spring. After the fruit is picked and the weather gets cold, the leaves drop off and the plant is bare until the following spring.","A typical vineyard in Bible times was surrounded by a stone fence. It had a stone tower from which the owner could watch for predators, and a place to squeeze the juice out of the fruits.","References to the vine and its fruits in the Bible are found in descriptions of farms, of sacrifices, and of social interaction."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Special significance:","headingHtml":"Special significance:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0273_grape\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0273_grape.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0273_grape\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Grapes — Fruit of the vine</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vitis_vinifera_a1.jpg • © Jerzy Opiola, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0273_grape.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>The vine is the most frequently cited plant in the Bible, and that alone makes it special. Vines, grapes, raisins, and wine were a major element of Jewish life, so it is not a surprise that the vine and its products are used figuratively probably more than any other Bible plant. After the flood purified the earth at the time of Noah, the vine became the means by which the human race was plunged again into sin (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:20</span>). We know from Jacob’s blessing in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:11; Gen 49:12</span>, from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 16:10</span>, from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 9:13</span>, and from many other passages that the vine was the symbol of blessing, prosperity, and happiness. The fact that there were groups like the Nazirites and Rechabites who abstained from drinking wine simply shows the radical self-denial that these people imposed on themselves (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 6:3; Num 6:4</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 35:2; Jer 35:5; Jer 35:6</span>). A drink offering of wine was an important part of worship (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:40</span>), and the image of contentment was “every man under his vine and under his fig tree” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 4:4</span>). Jotham includes the vine in his well-known Parable of the Trees (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:7</span> ff.). In the New Testament, Jesus rescued a man from humiliation at a wedding party by miraculously providing a fresh supply of wine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 2:1</span> ff.). He compared his teaching to wine. Wine becomes a major symbol in the Christian community when Jesus foreshadows his crucifixion by comparing the wine poured out in the Passover celebration to his blood (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 26:27; Matt 26:28; Matt 26:29</span>). He speaks of the need for Christians to be like the branches of the vine, drawing their nourishment from him, the True Vine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 15:1</span> ff.). Nearly every New Testament writer makes some metaphorical reference to the vine or its products.","The Hebrew word <em>shekar</em> (“strong drink”) probably refers to a alcoholic drink made from grain, honey or dates, but could also have been distilled from wine."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<strong>Vine and vineyard</strong>: There are around 65 kinds of grapevines (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>) found in the Northern Hemisphere. They belong to a larger family of creeping plants called <em>Vitaceae</em>, which has over 800 species throughout the world including many in the tropical and warm climates of the world.","Grapevines have occasionally been grown in West Africa (for example, in The Gambia and in northern Nigeria) but are not well known even where they are grown commercially. Attempts at substituting a local tree name have not been entirely successful because the species chosen is usually not cultivated and/or does not have the same economic or social function that the grape had in Israel.","Thus it is probably best to use a transliteration from a major language. However, in parts of Nigeria and perhaps elsewhere, the word <em>grep</em> refers to “grapefruit” and should be avoided in translation. A transliteration from “vine” or “wine” is preferred, although a translator needs to be careful. The English word “vine” refers to any creeping plant, but it also refers to a particular kind of vine that produces grapes (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>). This can be confusing. Furthermore, translators in English-speaking countries should think carefully about what they are going to do with the word “wine.” In The Gambia, Mandinka translators first used “wayini tree” but later concluded that it may be better to have a word for “vine” that is not necessarily identical with “wine.” <em>Bine</em>, from <em>binekaro</em> (“vinegar”), was considered, as was <em>inabi</em> (“grape”) from Arabic.","Languages that borrow the Arabic word <em>inabi</em> must deal with the fact that this word bears an unfortunate resemblance to <em>annabi</em> (“prophet”) and new readers reading “water of inabi” in a context of prophecy may associate it, for better or worse, with prophets and prophecy. In northern Nigeria church people have gotten used to <em>inabi</em> in the New Testament even though many of them don’t know what it is. Rubassa in Nigeria uses a wild grape-like plant (<em>afwafwa</em>)**, and Igala has used the same species (<em>achiwebetema</em>) for years. Likewise, two translations in Mali and Burkina Faso use their local name for a wild vine (<em>Lannea microcarpa</em>) for the biblical vine. There is a species (<em>Rhoicissus tridentata</em>) in southern and eastern Africa known as “African grape” (locally called “bobbejaantou”). In such cases translators should write a footnote (or glossary item) stating that the grapes of Bible times were larger and sweeter than the local variety, and that they were cultivated extensively as a source for producing beverages. Other possibilities for transliteration are: <em>vinyola</em> /<em>videra</em> (Portuguese), <em>vitis</em> (Latin), and <em>inab</em> (Arabic).","<strong>Fruit of the vine</strong> (Hebrew <em>‘enav</em>; Greek <em>botrus</em>, <em>staphulē</em>): There is some evidence that <em>botrus</em> refers to a bunch of grapes, while <em>staphulē</em> refers to individual grapes. According to Louw and Nida (<em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament based on Semantic Domains</em>), however, both words may refer to individual grapes as well as bunches of grapes. The Hebrew word <em>tirosh</em> is equivalent to the word “vintage” in English, that is, the grape harvest and possibly the first squeezing of the grapes. It is normally used along with the words referring to the olive harvest (<em>yitshar</em>) and grain harvest (<em>dagan</em>).","<strong>Vineyard</strong>: The typical translation solution for translating “vineyard” is to take the word chosen for “vine” and expand to “field/farm of vine trees.”","<strong>Beverages made from vine fruit</strong>: Grape juice contains yeast organisms that make it ferment naturally, converting natural sugar into alcohol or vinegar within a day or two, depending on the weather (Hepper, page 101). In normal wine preparation, the juice (called “must”) is allowed to ferment for six weeks, after which the clear liquid is poured out into another container leaving behind the sediment (the “lees”; see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11</span>) consisting of seeds, twigs, and skins. Once it is in sealed containers for storage it is called <em>yayin</em> in Hebrew. Translators from churches that require abstinence from alcohol are tempted to avoid or downplay the fact that <em>yayin</em> refers to an alcoholic drink. This is difficult to defend since the Jews had no refrigeration to keep <em>yayin</em> cool enough to prevent fermentation.","The Hebrew word <em>tirosh</em>, sometimes translated “new wine,” is problematical. There is no phrase “new wine” in the Hebrew Old Testament or the Septuagint translation of it. The Septuagint usually translated <em>tirosh</em> simply as wine (<em>oinos</em> in Greek). In the New Testament Jesus creates the phrase “new wine” for his parable of the wineskins, linking it with new wineskins (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 9:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 2:22</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 5:37; Luke 5:38</span>); it seems to be a made-up phrase there, not a technical expression. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 6:3; Num 6:4</span> the Nazirites were prohibited from drinking wine, strong drink, and vinegar, or even eating grapes or grapeskins, but <em>tirosh</em> is not mentioned there, suggesting that it may have even been an abstract term like the English word “vintage,” which refers to the grape harvest. The word <em>tirosh</em> is usually used with the Hebrew words for unprocessed grain (<em>dagan</em>) and olive oil (<em>yitshar</em>), in contexts that refer to the produce of the land. What <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> calls “new wine” in these passages is better rendered “vintage” in English. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 24:7</span> <em>tirosh</em> seems to refer to the grapevines themselves (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:15</span> it refers to grapes. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:24</span> it seems to refer to freshly squeezed grape juice. It occurs only twice with the Hebrew verb for “drink” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 62:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:15</span>), but in both those passages it can be taken as metonymic, not literal.","Some have tried to argue that <em>tirosh</em> was unfermented grape juice, which may be true in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:24</span>, but that is rather beside the point since it does not refer to a beverage in most cases. Even if <em>tirosh</em> is assumed to include the juice in its first stages on the first day after squeezing, it would have been mildly alcoholic since it has a kind of yeast in it and the Jews had no means of refrigeration. A case in point is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 4:11</span>, which says “<em>Yayin</em> and <em>tirosh</em> take away understanding.” Why? Surely because they contain alcohol! Another example is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:13</span>, where the grapevine in the Parable of the Trees says, “Shall I give up my <em>tirosh</em> that cheers gods and men?” I take <em>tirosh</em> here as a metonym for the final product. But if it is literal, why would it cheer anyone, if not because of its alcoholic content?","Sometimes translators, even if they concede the above, prefer to use a literal expression like “wayin” precisely because it is not well known, and thus hides the problem. This is not very satisfactory. They need to know that there are possibilities for translating these words contextually. For example, in passages where <em>tirosh</em> refers to a product of the land along with grain and oil, a phrase like “the juice of vayin fruit” is an acceptable translation of <em>tirosh</em>. In places where the reference is to drunkenness, the local word for alcoholic drink may be appropriate, and in fact, need not cause any offense. The compulsion to be concordant with English “wine” is what causes the problem.","On the other hand there are communities where <em>yayin</em>, <em>tirosh</em>, and the Greek word <em>oinos</em> have been translated using a word for a locally popular alcoholic brew, such as guinea corn (sorghum) beer. This, however, is not technically accurate. Properly speaking, wine is made from fruit, and beer from grain.","There are a few other Hebrew words that may refer to wine (for example <em>chemer</em>, <em>sove’</em>, <em>mezeg</em>; see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"REALIA:9.1\">9.1 Wine</a>) but they may be generic, or abstract, or poetic, or they refer to a drink made from fruit other than the fruit of the vine, such as pomegranates or dates, so we do not consider them here. In a number of places, wine is referred to indirectly. When a drink offering of wine was required, as in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 15:14</span>, the people are told to bring the offering “out of your wine press [<em>yeqev</em> in Hebrew].”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 28:7</span>: <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders the Hebrew word <em>shekar</em> in this verse as “strong drink.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> take it literally here, saying “fermented drink/liquor.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> is similar with “alcoholic drink.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, and others just use “wine.” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> cleverly does both by rendering this verse as “The wine for the proper drink-offering is to be a quarter of a hin to each ram; you are to pour out this strong drink … .”) Some commentators see this as a strange use of <em>shekar</em>, which normally refers to alcoholic drinks made from grain or honey. They think “wine” was intended and that a late editor used <em>shekar</em> possibly under the influence of Akkadians, who always talked about using <em>shikar</em> for any kind of libation. See <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, pages 374–375, for further discussion."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"גֶּפֶן","transliteration":"gefen","references":["Gen 40:9","Gen

The best-known member of the genus is the Persian Walnut or Common Walnut <em>Juglans regia</em>, native from the Balkans in southeastern Europe, southwestern and central Asia, and southwestern China.

Some English versions take “plants yielding seed” as referring to “grain” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>), whereas others use broader expressions such as “seed-bearing plants” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>) or “plants that bear seed” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). The writer of Genesis may be using a traditional Hebrew plant taxonomy that divides useful flora into two categories, namely seed-bearing plants and fruit-bearing plants. If so, translators should try to render “plants yielding seed” with an expression that includes more species than just the grains. After all, onions, beans, peas, melons, and other plants bear seeds, as well as grain.","The Hebrew word <em>dagan</em> occurs forty times in the Old Testament (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 27:28</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 27:37</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 18:12</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 18:27</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 7:13</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 11:14</span>), and it is often translated “grain.” However, in Bible times the word <em>dagan</em> included peas, beans, lentils, and cumin as well as what we normally call “grain” from grasses or cereals.

Four types are listed in the Bible: bitter herbs, garlic, leeks, and onions. Apart from these, we know from excavations in the Near East and from Greek and Roman literature that other species of leafy vegetables, such as garden peas and fenugreek (literally “Greek hay”), were harvested and eaten for centuries and even millennia before Bible times. They were almost certainly eaten in Bible times, even though we find no reference to them in Scripture.","The Hebrew word <em>‘esev</em>, which occurs thirty-three times in the Old Testament, means “herbs,” usually edible ones (see, for example <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:3</span>). According to Zohary, the Hebrew phrase <em>‘esev hassadeh</em> (“grass/plants of the field”) presumably refers to edible herbs, pot herbs, and other plants that were gathered in the wild (see, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26</span>). However, as domestication was still going on in Bible times, it is sometimes impossible to know whether a food item was cultivated or gathered.","Another generic Hebrew expression for vegetables is <em>’oroth</em> found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 4:39</span>, where a young prophet goes out to gather <em>’oroth</em> in the field. Zohary, noting that the incident took place near Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, suggests that <em>’oroth</em> may well refer to the garden rocket, known in Arabic as <em>jarjir</em>. His case rests on the fact that the Talmud equates <em>’oroth</em> with <em>gargir</em>. However, the context suggests a general word, so “vegetables” or “herbs” is still the best guess here. This is supported by the fact that the word is plural in form, as well as by the Aramaic translation, which uses a word that is unquestionably generic. <em>’Oroth</em> comes from the Hebrew root <em>’arah</em> (meaning “to gather, collect, pluck”), which also supports that it has here the general idea of “things gathered.”","Another generic Hebrew word here is <em>chatsir</em> (occurring twenty-two times), which Zohary says first referred to “leek” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 11:5</span>), but later changed to mean “grazing grass” or “field herbs” (see, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 37:2</span>).","The Hebrew noun <em>deshe’</em> (occurring fourteen times) is a general term for any plant. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> uses this noun and it verbal form, which are rendered “put forth vegetation.”","Another general Hebrew word for vegetables is <em>yaraq</em>, which occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 11:10; 1 Kgs 21:2; Prov 15:17</span>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 21:2</span> King Ahab covets Naboth’s vineyard to use as his <em>gan yaraq</em> (“vegetable garden”). This sort of expression can cause problems for translators because of the taxonomy and availability of generic terms. Many languages will have words for various types of agricultural plots depending on what is cultivated therein. Naboth’s vineyard was right next to the king’s palace, so the word for “vegetable garden” needs to be appropriate to that situation. If no specific word is available, translators may use a phrase such as “place where I can grow vegetables” or “place where I can plant things.”","The Hebrew word <em>zeru‘a</em> /<em>zero‘nim</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:37; Isa 61:11; Dan 1:12; Dan 1:16</span>) is a nominal form of the verb “to plant,” and it literally means “thing sown.” Some versions have rendered it “seed,” “plant” or “what is sown,” depending on the context. Several versions use “vegetables” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 1:12; Dan 1:16</span>.","The Greek word <em>lachanon</em> is a generic word for vegetables in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rom 14:2</span>.

Since the context is rhetorical, translators striving for poetic impact may look for a cultural equivalent—a plant that is known to be tasteless, or something else unpleasant like a raw egg white.","An important question here is this: Is <em>challamuth</em> something totally inedible, or is it something that is edible if you put salt on it? In Africa, where okra and roselle are well known (and slimy), such a plant could be used. However, translators should be careful since both okra and rosella are eaten frequently in soup and are considered delicious! <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em> gives about equal weight to “purslane,” “mallow,” “milkweed,” and “egg white,” and finally commends “egg white” as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>. However, if translators wish to take <em>challamuth</em> as a plant, we offer the following basic models based on two alternative assumptions:","1. If the Hebrew words <em>tafel</em> (“that which is tasteless”) and <em>rir challamuth</em> (“slime of the purslane”) refer to totally inedible substances, two possible renderings of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 6:6</span> are:","“No one could swallow what I have been given to eat. It is like plaster, like the sap of milkweed [or, euphorbia cactus / mallow].”","“No one can eat whitewash [or, plaster/sand/straw/cotton]. There is no taste in milkweed sap [or, euphorbia sap].”","2. If these Hebrew words refer to edible but tasteless substances, two possible models are:","“No one could swallow what I have been given to eat. It is like pap [or, raw cassava or some local very plain food without much taste] without salt, like the sap of mallow [or, the juice of some tasteless but edible plant].”","“No one can eat pap [or, raw cassava or some local flat-tasting food such as rice] without salt. There is no taste in the sap of mallow [or, the juice of some tasteless but edible plant.]”","Any of these renderings prepare the reader for Job’s next line: “My appetite refuses to touch them.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 24:24</span>: According to <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr>, the Hebrew word <em>kakol</em> rendered “like the mallow” can either mean “like all” or “like the umbel.” (An umbel is a flower cluster that has a common axis.) If it is true that the Hebrew verb following <em>kakol</em> actually means “to close up,” then “umbel” is odd because umbellate flowers, to my knowledge, do not “close up.” So, if translators follow <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr> here, the meaning “like all” is recommended. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> follows this sense by rendering the second line of this verse as “they are brought low and gathered up like all others” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, Wolfers).","The Septuagint translates <em>kol</em> as the plant called “saltwort,” according to Pope.

Many plants were in fact used for both incense and medicine. Sweet-smelling goods were an important element of Middle Eastern life in Bible times, as is shown by the fact that Ishmaelites in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:25</span> were carrying “gum, balm, and myrrh” down to Egypt, and Jacob sent the same goods with his sons as a gift to Pharaoh (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 43:11</span>). Cassia and calamus are listed as trade goods from Syria in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 27:19</span>, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 2:11</span> tells us that scholar-kings brought frankincense and myrrh from the East to Jerusalem. Still others are listed in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:13</span>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:23–Exod 30:25</span> God instructs Moses to take the finest spices and make anointing oil to anoint the priests. Incense was integral to worship, both pagan and Jewish. Spices were also used in embalming, as we know from the story of Jesus’ burial.","Spices come from a variety of sources. Some are lumps of hardened sap (gum, resin) from shrubs; others are the dried leaves or flowers of plants; still others are from the wood or roots of trees. We divide the sixteen plants covered here into two groups: 1) incense and perfume, and 2) balm and ointment. A number of items—gall, henbane, poison hemlock, wormwood and mandrake—do not quite fit in. We will deal with those in Chapter 5.","Before considering the various species, let us take a moment to deal with some generic issues, first in English and then in the biblical languages. The English word “spice” refers primarily to substances that give flavor to food such as cinnamon or pepper. However, when we speak of the “spice trade” we usually include all sorts of other substances that may be used for medicine, perfume, and incense as well.","The English word “balm” can refer to “any of various aromatic resinous substances used for healing and soothing” (<em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>). However, it is also used more specifically to refer to medicinal oil that comes from various tropical trees, and especially those of the genus <em>Commiphora</em>. One of these is the Balsam or Opobalsamum <em>Commiphora gileadensis</em>, from which we get the shortened name “balm.”","Related to the above is the fact that in many languages, a tree may have a different name from the substance it produces. For example, “mastic” comes from the lentisk tree and “ladanum” comes from the rock rose. “Stacte” comes from several kinds of trees, and “storax” comes from the Oriental sweetgum. Stacte and storax are often used interchangeably, as are storax and styrax by some writers, although we distinguish the two in this book.","As for generic terms in Hebrew, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:23–Exod 30:25</span> God instructs Moses to take the finest “spices” (<em>bosem</em>) to make anointing oil. Zohary (page 198) describes the Hebrew word <em>bosem</em> as originally the name of a specific shrub (<em>Commiphora gileadensis</em>) but later it referred to all species of the genus <em>Commiphora</em> and their products. Does <em>bosem</em> refer to dry or liquid substances in this passage? Durham favors dry substances on the grounds that the measurement is in weight rather than volume. However, it could also have been a mixture consisting of the dry ingredients pulverized and mixed in with the liquid ones and the oil. Most English versions of this passage translate <em>bosem</em> as a cover term for the four specific substances that follow: <em>mor deror</em> (“liquid myrrh”), <em>qinnemon besem</em> (“sweet-smelling cinnamon”), <em>qeneh bosem</em> (“aromatic cane”), and <em>qiddah</em> (“cassia”). In translating this passage, a general word or phrase such as “sweet-smelling spices” is recommended for <em>bosem</em>. <em>Bosem</em> and its derivatives (<em>basam</em>, <em>besem</em>) occur at least thirty times in the Bible.","A related generic Hebrew word that may cause problems for translators is <em>sam</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:34</span>, where Moses is given the formula for incense. The English versions use various expressions for <em>sam</em> in this verse; for example, “sweet spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>), “fragrant spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “aromatic substances” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “herbs” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>), and “costly spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>). This general word for spices introduces the four substances that made up the incense burned in the Tabernacle, namely <em>nataf</em> (“stacte”), <em>shecheleth</em> (“onycha”), <em>chelbenah</em> (“galbanum”), and <em>levonah</em> (“frankincense”), which will be dealt with below. The word <em>sam</em> occurs sixteen times in the Old Testament.","The Hebrew word <em>tsori</em> is translated “balm” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, but Zohary takes it to refer to a specific plant, namely the Storax <em>Liquidambar orientalis</em>, and Moldenke takes it to be the Egyptian balsam (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:4.2.3\">4.2.3 Liquidambar (Oriental sweetgum, storax)</a>).","The Hebrew word <em>bedolach</em> is problematic. It occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 2:12</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 11:7</span>, where <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> transliterate it as “bdellium.” Botanists have generally held that this Hebrew word does not refer to a plant product. However, a surprising number of versions render it “resin” or “perfume” with one qualifying word or another (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). The Septuagint used the Greek word <em>anthrax</em>, which is a red stone (for example, carbuncle). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr> says “pearls.” Perhaps the safest course is to transliterate <em>bedolach</em>, with or without footnoting other possibilities.","Generic Greek words for spices include <em>arōma</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 16:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 23:56</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 19:40</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 24:15</span>) and <em>amōmon</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:13</span>)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":["FLORA:4.2.3"]},{"key":"4.1","book":"flora","title":"Trees and plants yielding incense and perfume","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.1.1","book":"flora","title":"Agarwood (eaglewood, aloeswood, lignaloes)","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲהָלִים","transliteration":"’ahalim","references":["Num 24:6","Prov 7:17"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲהָלוֹת","transliteration":"’ahaloth","references":["Ps 45:9","Song 4:14"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0016_agarwood\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0016_agarwood.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0016_agarwood\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Agarwood — Agarwood tree</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Aquilaria_tree_see_under_to_above.jpg • © DXLINH, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0016_agarwood.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Zohary confidently identifies the Hebrew word <em>’ahaloth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:9</span> (8) as referring to the Agarwood or Eaglewood <em>Aquillaria agallocha</em>, which is a tree native to northern India. (He also says it is native to East Africa, but this seems to be a mistake). The ancient Greek writer Dioscorides calls the eaglewood <em>agallochon</em>, a wood found in India and Arabia. This view is supported by Anderson and the commentators Snaith and Budd. Hepper, who is generally suspicious of claims about trade with the Far East in this period of history, doubts this identification but goes along with it for lack of an alternative. The chips of the wood are sold in India under the name <em>agar</em> (Hepper, page 140) and burned as incense. Expeditions like those of King Solomon (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 9:26–1 Kgs 9:28</span>) may have brought this precious commodity from India by way of mysterious places like Tema (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 6:19</span>) or Dedan (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 21:13</span>), possibly in the Arabian Peninsula.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 24:6</span> the Hebrew word <em>’ahalim</em> does not refer to the fragrant chips of the agarwood tree, but the actual trees. The last two lines of this verse read “like aloes [<em>’ahalim</em> ] that the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LORD</abbr> has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.” These parallel lines suggest verdant growth. If the agarwood trees actually grew only in the Far East, what would Balaam or the writer of Numbers know about how they looked?

This resin has been a highly valued part of both Buddhist and Islamic ceremonies for many centuries, as well as being used for perfume and for medicine.

In Arabic agarwood is called <em>oud</em> (“wood”), the name used also by perfumers in Europe, but it is rarely seen because of its high cost. The tree is called <em>jin-koh</em> in Japanese, <em>chen-xiang</em> in Chinese, and <em>gaharu</em> in Indonesian. Elsewhere, translators will need to consider how they deal with the word pair myrrh and agar. If “myrrh” is transliterated, then “agar” could also be transliterated. In Asia the tree takes its name from the product (agar). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:9; Prov 7:17; Song 4:14</span>, it is the name of the substance that would be transliterated (“agar”), not the tree (“agarwood”).

Many botanists have held that this word refers to any of three or four sweet-smelling grasses of the genus <em>Cymbopogon</em>, one of which grows wild in Israel. That would be one option. Another is that it was imported from India, where other fragrant types of <em>Cymbopogon</em> were and are cultivated, such as Ginger Grass <em>Cymbopogon martinii</em>, Camel Grass <em>Cymbopogon schoenanthrus</em>, and Lemon Grass <em>Cymbopogon citratus</em>. Of these, Zohary and Moldenke both favor “ginger grass,” which is also called “sweet calamus.” However, the real Calamus <em>Acorus calamus</em> is a third possibility. It is a reed-like plant, more popularly known as the “sweet flag.” The origin of this plant is hotly debated, but it may have started from India and spread in marshy ground across Europe, picking up names like flagroot, myrtle flag, myrtle sedge, sweet root, and sweet sedge. The Egyptologist Joret believes it was used by the Pharaohs. The botanist Burkill holds that the Greeks used the ginger-like roots of the sweet flag, but confused them with the roots of the true ginger grass, leaving a legacy of confusion behind them (Hepper, page 144)."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Ginger grass (option 2) grows in clumps to more than a meter (3 feet) high and has stiff leaves like sword grass.

Translators from Asia will probably find local names for ginger grass or lemon grass. Alternatively, the translator could transliterate from Greek (<em>kalamos</em>) with or without the word for “sweet.” Since the extract of calamus/ginger grass is an oil, one could translate “sweet-smelling kalamos oil.” Translators can also consider transliterating from a major language (for example, French <em>verveine</em>, <em>citronelle</em>; Portuguese <em>erva</em> -<em>cideira</em>; Spanish <em>limonaria</em>, <em>paja</em><em>de</em><em>Meca</em>, <em>Pasto cetron</em>, <em>Zacate lemon</em>, <em>palmarosa</em>; Chinese <em>shihch'ang pu</em>)."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קָנֶה","transliteration":"qaneh","references":["Song 4:14","Isa 43:24","Ezek 27:19"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קְנֵה־בֹשֶׂם","transliteration":"qeneh bosem","references":["Exod 30:23"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קָנֶה הַטּוֹב","transliteration":"qaneh hattov","references":["Jer 6:20"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Song 4:14","Isa 43:24","Ezek 27:19","Exod 30:23","Jer 6:20"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.1.3","book":"flora","title":"Cassia","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קִדָּה","transliteration":"qiddah","references":["Exod 30:24","Ezek 27:19"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קְצִיעָה","transliteration":"qetsi‘ah","references":["Ps 45:9"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0112_cassia\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0112_cassia.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0112_cassia\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Cassia tree</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cinnamomum_tamala_W_IMG_2434.jpg • © J.

The name “cassia” may possibly come from the Khasi people of northeastern India and Bangladesh; earlier they lived in the area of Assam and Burma and were involved in the ancient cassia trade. So cassia oil may have been brought into Israel from East Asia. However, with respect to “cassia” and “cinnamon” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:23; Exod 30:24</span>, Hepper argues that these spices were probably not Asian spices as has often been supposed. Quoting research by Lucas and Harris on ancient Egyptian materials, he says that there is no evidence of these Asian spices in tombs in Egypt (Hepper, page 138). If they were being transported by the deprived Israelites, why were they not used by the more prosperous Egyptians? Further, how was Moses to have access to these substances in remote Sinai? Hepper favors southern Arabia and northeastern Africa as sources for fragrant barks and resins.

species of grass in the Holy Land, and it is unlikely that the Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin words above refer to particular species. They are probably generic words that have at one time or other, or in one place or another, referred to various kinds of grass.","According to Zohary, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 41:2; Gen 41:18</span> the Hebrew word <em>’achu</em> (“reed grass”) refers not to a kind of grass but to “damp swampy land used for grazing” (page 127; see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> “meadow”). However, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 8:11</span> seems to speak specifically of some kind of plant (parallel to papyrus), stating that <em>’achu</em> cannot grow where there is no water.","The Hebrew word <em>chashash</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 5:24</span> is used for dry grass, parallel to stubble, referring to the wicked who will be burned up. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 33:11</span> the futile plans of the wicked are likened to <em>chashash</em>, again parallel to stubble.","The eight occurrences of the Hebrew word <em>yereq</em> (“green”) in the Old Testament refer to vegetation. Most of them occur in a phrase such as <em>yereq ‘esev</em> (rendered “green plant” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:30; Gen 9:3</span>) or <em>yereq deshe’</em> (rendered “tender grass” or “green herb” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26; Ps 37:2; Isa 37:27</span>). However, in three passages <em>yereq</em> stands alone (rendered “grass,” “verdue,” or “green thing” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 10:15; Num 22:4; Isa 15:6</span>).","The Hebrew word <em>deshe’</em> is sometimes translated “grass.” It usually occurs in rhetorical contexts, where it is often parallel to <em>chatsir</em>, <em>yereq</em>, or <em>‘esev</em>.","The Hebrew word <em>‘esev</em> occurs thirty-three times in the Bible and is translated by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> as “plant” in twelve of them, as “grass” in twelve, as “herb” or “herbage” in five, and as “vegetation” in four. Since there may be languages that have no generic word like “plant,” they may be able to use their word for “grass” or “growing things” in many of these passages when it is appropriate.","There are a number of words for “pasture,” the grassy fields in which sheep, goats, and cows like to graze. Hebrew has not less than five words: apart from <em>mir‘eh</em>, listed above, there are also <em>migrash</em> (114 times, mostly in Joshua and 1 Chronicles), <em>dover</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 5:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 2:12</span>), <em>kar</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 37:20</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 65:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:23</span>), and <em>nawah</em> (11 times).","Apart from all of the above, there is also the Hebrew word <em>teven</em>, which is translated “straw”—dried grass used for bricks and as bedding for animals. For example, this word occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:25; Gen 24:32</span>, but translators need to be aware that “straw” for the camels was not for the camels to eat but rather was put on the ground to absorb the urine of the animals.","There are two Hebrew words that are usually translated “fodder” (that is, animal food) or “provender”: <em>belil</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 6:5</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 24:6</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:24</span>) and <em>mispo’</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:25</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:32</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 42:27</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 43:24</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 19:19</span>). These words probably refer to some type of grass.","In the New Testament the Greek word <em>chortos</em> occurs fifteen times and is usually translated by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> as “grass.”","The Greek word <em>lachanon</em> occurs four times in the New Testament. It is a generic term for garden plants that can be translated according to its context. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 13:32; Mark 4:32</span> the mustard seed grows to become bigger than all the <em>lachanon</em> (“shrubs”) of the garden. The Pharisees tithe mint, rue, and every <em>lachanon</em> (“herb”) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:42</span>.

It is possible that such a distinction was present in Hebrew as well, but at this point we don’t know about it. Before translating, it will be important to investigate how the local people categorize the plant world. Once the local taxonomy is known, the translators can decide how much or how little of it they want to use, depending on their general principles of accommodation in the translation as a whole.","Where possible, the Hebrew word <em>deshe’</em> should carry the meaning of new growth or fresh sprouts of a plant. Since it usually occurs in rhetorical contexts and is often parallel with other references to grass, the translator needs to think of pairs or triplets of words that refer to grass and grass-like plants.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> a: “Let the earth put forth vegetation [<em>deshe’</em> ].” On the basis of this verse’s parallelism with verse 20, I support the majority view here that there are two categories with a generic introducer (see the <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:5.1\">introductory comments</a> on this section). The translator needs the most general word for plants here to render <em>deshe’</em>.* If there is no generic word available, a phrase such as “things with leaves” or “sprouting things” is appropriate. As a last resort, one could simply omit the generic term and translate the specifics.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> b: “Plants yielding seed.” It is difficult to know if the Hebrew phrase here (<em>‘esev mazri‘a zera‘</em>) is talking about plants whose “fruit” is a seed, like rice, or any kind of plants that have seeds, including tomatoes, peppers, grapes, eggplants, and so forth. The English versions stay ambiguous; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> “those that bear grain,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “grain,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> “some to make grain for seeds,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “seed-bearing plants” (also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>; similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>), and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> “plants that bear seed.” “Grain” (equivalent to “corn” in British English) may be too narrow. In either case, this category is set off against what follows, namely, fruit-bearing plants like apples and mangoes.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> c: “Fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed.” The issue here is whether the Hebrew phrase <em>’asher zar‘o vo</em> (“in which is their seed”) is a redundant expression like “of the air” after birds, or whether the phrase actually adds information. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> take it as redundant (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> “those that bear fruit,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “fruit trees”). Others seem to feel it necessary to retain this phrase (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> “others to make fruits with seeds in them,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> “fruit trees … bearing fruit with their seed inside” [similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> ]).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> d: “Each according to its kind.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr> says “each according to its own type.” There seem to be three interpretations of the Hebrew phrase here in the English versions:","1. Some take it as emphasizing the multiplicity of plant types; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> say “all kinds of plants” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>).","2. Some seem to focus on the categorization of plants; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> says “according to their various kinds,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> has “each corresponding to its own species.”","3. Some focus on the reproductivity of plants; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “Every seed will produce more of its own kind of plant” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> has “The seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” Compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, which reads “each with its own kind of seed.”","A major theme of the writer in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> seems to be the orderliness—the categories and subcategories—of creation. This supports <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>. But the repeated use of “seed” indicates that the writer is also interested in the regularity of genetic laws. Echoing this theme, Deuteronomy includes laws strictly forbidding the mixture of different kinds (“seeds” in some languages!) of plants in farms and fibers in clothes. Christ added his own version to this Hebrew concern when he said, “Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 7:16</span>). Possible models for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> are:","1. Let the earth be covered with plants. Let there be plants with seeds [or, a local subcategory] and trees with fruit [or, a local subcategory]. Let each one have a different kind of seed.","2. Let different kinds of plants sprout from the ground and cover the whole earth. Let there be grass, shrubs, and trees [or, plants with seeds and trees with fruit; or, grain, vegetables, and fruit trees]. Let each kind produce its own.","Translators, after carefully studying the categorization system of their own language, should consider which of the two basic structures of this verse matches their own best. It is quite possible that the three-way division taken by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> and some commentaries would fit the local system better. If so, there is no harm in following it.","Once translators have investigated their local taxonomy, they must decide whether to use it or to try to express the Hebrew categorization. In the absence of middle level generic terms, translators could say “plants like rice” and “plants like mangos,” though this carries the hazard of implying that the original audience had rice or mangos.","The Hebrew categorization is more typological than strictly logical or scientific, so it leaves us with overlap and ambiguity. Probably the most important thing that the writer intends to show is the orderliness of God’s creation.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26</span>: The last two lines of this verse read “like grass [<em>chatsir</em> ] on the housetops; blighted before it is grown” (also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 37:27</span>; similarly <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 129:6</span>). These lines gives us a picture of a house with a flat roof where dust could settle, forming a fertile but shallow environment for the germination of grass seeds. However, the grass was doomed to wither and die quickly because of the lack of moisture and soil. There is a textual problem with the last line. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr> backs the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr>, which reads “blighted/scorced before it rises” (<em>shedefah lifne qamah</em>). It gives a “C” rating to the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> over against the conjecture, which reads “blighted/scorched before the east wind” (<em>shedefah lifne qadim</em>). The conjection is followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr> concludes that the copyist(s), lacking sufficient knowledge of Hebrew, didn’t understand this line and guessed that it might have meant “scorched by the east wind,” which is also very logical. The consensus appears to follow the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> also follows the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> by saying “blasted

A document from Gezer (in Israel) from around King Saul’s time (1000 <abbr class=\"bible-version\">B.C.</abbr>) refers to the cultivation of flax and states that flax and wool were the main materials for making cloth. According to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:6</span>, the Israelite spies were hidden under flax stalks by Rahab. Flax was grown extensively in Egypt and made into cloth and mats.","<em>Pesheth</em> and <em>pishtah</em> are probably the original Hebrew words for flax, if indeed the plant was domesticated in the Holy Land, as Zohary proposes. They may be related to the word <em>pashat</em>, meaning “to strip off” or “to flay,” or to the word <em>pasas</em>, meaning “to disintegrate.” <em>Pesheth</em> and <em>pishtah</em> are used twenty times in the Old Testament, twice referring clearly to the plant itself (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 9:31; Josh 2:6</span>). Other references are to the processed flax (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 15:14; Prov 31:13; Isa 19:9; Hos 2:7; Hos 2:11</span> [5, 9]). A few cases refer to finished products, namely wicks (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3; Isa 43:17</span>), cords (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:3</span>), and items of clothing (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 13:1; Ezek 44:17; Ezek 44:18; Ezek 44:18</span>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0234_flax_flower\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0234_flax_flower.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0234_flax_flower\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Flax — Flowers of the flax plant (Linum pubescens)</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linum-pubescens-Zachi-Evenor-003.jpg • © Zachi Evenor (File:Linum-pubescens-Zachi-Evenor-001.jpg), CC BY 3.0 or CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0234_flax_flower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>It is likely that the Hebrews acquired the word <em>shesh</em> from the Egyptians during their sojourn in Egypt, since flax was cultivated there also. The Egyptian word for flax was <em>shent</em> (via <em>shen-suten</em>). <em>Shesh</em> is used thirty-eight times in the Old Testament: for the material that Pharaoh put on Joseph, for the Tabernacle curtains and hangings in Exodus, for the ephod, and for the priests’ tunics. The wise woman of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:22</span> wears it. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 16:10; Ezek 16:13; Ezek 16:13</span> it is paired with silk, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 27:7</span> “<em>shesh</em> from Egypt” is spoken of as material for the sails of ships.","Several references to linen use the Hebrew word <em>bad</em>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 28:42</span> the priests’ underwear are made from <em>bad</em>, and it is used thereafter in Leviticus to describe various items of clothing—coat, breeches, girdle, and turban. It turns up again in Samuel’s and King David’s “ephods” and then again in Ezekiel and Daniel, where we see visions of “a man clothed in <em>bad</em>.”","Linen is referred by the Hebrew word <em>buts</em> in 1–2 Chronicles, Esther, and Ezekiel, where the robes of the Temple choir, kings, and rich men are described. Moldenke holds that this word is Assyrian and refers to linen coming from the East. But it could also be a loanword from Egyptian (compare Egyptian <em>nbos</em> “to clothe”); note also the Hebrew verb <em>bots</em> /<em>bits</em>, meaning “whiten” or “bleach” (<em>Unger’s Bible Dictionary</em>). The Septuagint often uses the Greek word <em>bussos</em> or <em>bussinos</em> in these passages.","The Old Testament has four references to the Hebrew word <em>sadin</em> (“linen garment”): <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 14:12</span> (Samson promises them to his opponents), <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:24</span> (the wise woman makes them), and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:23</span> (the rich women of Jerusalem wear them). The Septuagint uses the Greek word <em>bussos</em> or <em>sindōn</em> in these passages.","The Hebrew word <em>’etun</em> occurs only in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 7:16</span>, where it refers to a linen bedspread from Egypt (compare the Greek word <em>othonion</em> for burial cloths, and the Greek word <em>othonē</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 10:11</span> for the sheet in Peter’s vision). Here the Septuagint uses the Greek word <em>amphitapos</em>, which normally referred to a double-sided rug.","In the New Testament there are three primary Greek words for linen: <em>linon</em> /<em>linous</em>, <em>sindōn</em>, and <em>othonē</em> /<em>othonion</em>. <em>Linon</em> is used to refer to garments of the angels in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 15:6</span> as well as to the “smoldering wick” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 12:20</span> (quoting <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3</span> and using the same Greek word as in the Septuagint of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3</span>). The synoptic Gospel writers refer to the linen cloth that Joseph and Nicodemus used to wrap Jesus’ body as a <em>sindōn</em>. Mark uses the same word to refer to the cloth that was worn by the unidentified young man at the time of Jesus’ arrest (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 14:51; Mark 14:52</span>). John uses a different Greek word for Jesus’ burial cloths: <em>othonion</em>.","The rich man referred to in the Lazarus story (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 16:19</span>) is clothed in “fine linen” (<em>bussos</em>). The Greek word <em>bussos</em> is the root word for <em>bussinos</em>, which refers to tunics, robes and turbans made from linen fabric (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:16</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 19:8; Rev 19:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 19:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 151 3:6</span>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0232_flax_cutting\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0232_flax_cutting.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0232_flax_cutting\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Flax — Woman cutting flax</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BreakingFlax.jpeg • Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii, Public domain, Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0232_flax_cutting.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>It is often difficult to tell whether the Hebrew and Greek words for linen refer to a material or to an item of clothing such as a shirt, robe, tunic, or coat.

It has been used for food, for medicine, and for various utensils and musical instruments. It is indigenous to Africa but was probably introduced into Asia and the Americas about ten thousand years ago, with or without the help of humans. The name of the genus comes from the Latin word <em>lagoena</em>, meaning “flask” (but almost certainly the first Roman flasks were dried gourds). The species name is derived from the Latin word for “dry,” suggesting that the fruit is usable in its dried form. Although the people of the Bible lands undoubtedly used the split bottle gourds in their homes as bowls or “dippers,” as we find in Africa and Asia, the only references we have are to the image of the gourd in the artwork carved into the cedar of King Solomon’s palace (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:18</span>) and in the decorating of the giant bronze basin that stood in front of the Temple (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:24; 1 Kgs 7:24</span>).

Compounding the confusion, some botanists have called the biblical marjoram “Syrian hyssop.” <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</em> suggests that <em>’ezov</em> may have included various plants. We encourage “marjoram” and hold that the term “Syrian hyssop” is Eurocentric. The words <em>’ezov</em> and <em>hussōpos</em> are cognate. A number of botanists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries looked at the Arabic word for “caper bush” (<em>el asaf</em>, which became <em>lassaf</em>) and speculated that <em>’ezov</em> in the Pentateuch must refer to the caper bush (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:3.5.1\">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</a>), which was plentiful in Egypt and the Arabian Desert. Indeed, a caper bush growing out of a wall in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> (4.33) makes much more sense than a marjoram plant in that environment. <em>’Ezov</em> was required in the Jewish purification ceremonies. Is it possible that as the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, where they found plenty of marjoram, that the ceremony of purification evolved, and that the “legal” definition of <em>’ezov</em> could have generalized to include the marjoram? It is a hairy plant very handy for sprinkling. In the New Testament, then, the word <em>hussōpos</em> in John could plausibly refer to a stalk of the marjoram."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The marjoram plant stands 50–80 centimeters tall (20–32 inches) and has small leaves, and a many-branched, hairy stem.

This marked the beginning of the Passover Feast, commemorated ever since by Jews. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 51:9</span> (7) <em>’ezov</em> is used to symbolize spiritual cleansing. A third, and problematic, reference, occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> (4.33; see the comments below), where <em>’ezov</em> is used to refer to a humble plant that contrasts with the might and grandeur of the cedar of Lebanon."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Many English versions, except for <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, bow under the pressure of tradition and use “hyssop” as the rendering for <em>’ezov</em>. Translators are not obliged to follow suit. If the opportunity arises, they should follow the more scientifically correct “marjoram.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 12:22</span> a: “Take a bunch of hyssop [<em>’ezov</em> ] and dip it in the blood.” The function of <em>’ezov</em> in Exodus is more important than the plant itself, and even if one uses a transliteration like “branch of esov,” a verb such as “sprinkle” helps to convey the picture. If the translator chooses to substitute a local plant typically used for sprinkling, a footnote is in order. If translators are used to transliterating from English, “marjoram” is preferred, not “hyssop.” On the other hand, a translator can transliterate from Latin <em>majorana</em>, Spanish <em>mejorana</em>, or Arabic <em>mardakush</em>. So some of the options for rendering “marjoram” are the following:","1. a generic expression, for example, “leaves”;","2. a transliteration (see above);","3. a substitution, that is, a local plant used for sprinkling (plus footnote).","For translators in West Africa who want to use a plant like marjoram, there are marjoram relatives. One such hairy-leafed plant grows in The Gambia and is used as a mosquito repellent. The Tiv of Nigeria call the same plant <em>huuhuu</em>, and the Etsako of Nigeria refer to it as “mosquito grass.” The leaves have a spicy smell and the plant, being hairy, is good as a kind of brush.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> a (4.33a): “He [Solomon] spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop [<em>’ezov</em> ] that grows out of the wall.” This verse has three puzzles:","1. Marjoram (like the European hyssop) is not a tree. It is a relatively low plant with tiny leaves and white flowers. If the translator has a generic word covering both “trees” and “plants,” that should be used. De Vries holds that the Hebrew word <em>‘ets</em> (“tree”) has wider range of meaning than the English word “tree,” because it includes what we would call vines (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 15:2</span>). Still, stretching the word <em>‘ets</em> to include a plant like marjoram is expecting quite a bit, which is partly why a few scholars are still unconvinced that <em>’ezov</em> is the marjoram plant. Hepper, for example, is inclined to agree with Tristram and Balfour who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that <em>’ezov</em> here refers to the caper bush (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:3.5.1\">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</a>). Part of their argument rests on cognate evidence: Arabic for the caper bush is <em>lassaf</em> (derived from <em>el asaf</em>), which appears to be cognate with <em>’ezov</em>, but the Arabic word for the marjoram (<em>zaatar</em>) is completely unrelated. Someone could argue that the caper is not a tree either, but, significantly, it does have a woody stem.","2. “<em>’Ezov</em> that grows out of the wall” is odd because, in real life, marjoram does not typically grow in the cracks of walls. It likes rocky soil, but is quite unlikely to find its way to walls. Was King Solomon, the great biologist, wrong on a botanical detail that would have been obvious even to school children?","3. Artistically, in this verse, something that grows out of a crack in a wall would make a more striking contrast to the mighty cedar than marjoram would. The caper bush, mentioned above, is an excellent candidate, because it does indeed grow in the cracks of city walls, apart from being a good contrast with the cedar. However, later botanists have not supported this opinion. Also, wider biblical usage votes against it. In Exodus <em>’ezov</em> is used in bunches to sprinkle blood on doorposts. The marjoram, with its hairy stem, is quite suited for such a use. The caper bush is less so. Is it possible that <em>’ezov</em> refers to two different plants in the different contexts? This would not be unprecedented. Zohary, for example, holds that the Hebrew word <em>berosh</em> refers to “cypress” in some contexts and to “fir” in others (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.6\">1.6 Cypress</a>). The same is true of the Hebrew word <em>suf</em>, which can mean “cattail” or “seaweed” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:5.1.1\">5.1.1 Cattail (reed-mace)</a>).","A final piece of evidence that, unfortunately, does not resolve the issue is that the caper bush is abundant in the desert, whereas marjoram prefers cultivated, moister terrain. There may have been marjoram in Egypt when the Israelites left there, but once in the desert they would not have found it. Were they perhaps forced by necessity to use the caper bush for their sprinkling rituals?","The following is a summary of translation options for <em>’ezov</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> (4.33):","1. transliterate from <em>’ezov</em> (<em>esobu</em>, <em>esofi</em>) or marjoram (<em>marjoramu</em>, <em>macora</em>);","2. substitute a local plant that is capable of growing on a wall.","One possible model for the first half of this verse is “Solomon spoke of all kinds of plants/growing things, even the mighty kedari tree of Lebanon [Mountains], and the [little] majoram/esob/kaper/kafer/asafu that can grow on a city wall.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵזוֹב","transliteration":"’ezov","references":["Exod 12:22","Lev 14:4","Lev 14:6","Lev 14:49","Lev 14:51","Lev 14:52","Num 19:6","Num 19:18","1 Kgs 5:13","Ps 51:9"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ὕσσωπος","transliteration":"hussōpos","references":["John 19:29","Heb 9:19"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 12:22","Lev 14:4","Lev 14:6","Lev 14:49","Lev 14:51","Lev 14:52","Num 19:6","Num 19:18","1 Kgs 5:13","Ps 51:9","John 19:29","Heb 9:19"],"crossRefs":["FLORA:1.6","FLORA:3.5.1","FLORA:5.1.1"]},{"key":"5.2.5","book":"flora","title":"Poison hemlock (black henbane, gall)","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"רֹאשׁ, רוֹשׁ","transliteration":"ro’sh, rosh","references":["Deut 29:17","Deut 32:32","Ps 69:22","Jer 8:14","Jer 9:14","Jer 23:15","Lam 3:5","Lam 3:19","Hos 10:4","Amos 6:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"χολή","transliteration":"cholē","references":["Matt 27:34","Acts 8:23"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0290_hemlock\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0290_hemlock.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0290_hemlock\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Henbane — A botanical drawing of black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger)</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hyoscyamus_niger_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-073.jpg • Franz E.

This plant is a member of the carrot family and has no relation to the evergreen tree with the same name. Hepper says that the word <em>ro’sh</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 10:4</span> (“… like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field”) probably does not refer to hemlock, since hemlock does not normally grow in cultivated ground. According to him, this passage refers more likely to Veined Henbane <em>Hyoscyamus reticulatus</em>. Of the ten Old Testament references to <em>ro’sh</em> /<em>rosh</em>, five are translated with the Greek word <em>cholē</em> (“gall”) in the Septuagint. This suggests that <em>ro’sh/rosh</em> was taken as a generic word referring to a bitter, poisonous substance, not necessarily of botanical origin. The <em>ro’sh</em> mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 32:33</span> is from a snake, the the <em>cholē</em> of Tobit is from a fish (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 6:4; Tob 6:5; Tob 6:7</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 6:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 11:4</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 11:8</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 11:11</span>).","According to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 15:23</span>, Jesus was offered “wine mingled with myrrh” just before his crucifixion, possibly by his followers, as a sedative.

Readers are reminded that this book is primarily directed to the needs of translators, so it focuses on the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words, what they meant, and how they can be translated in a way that preserves both accuracy (in prose contexts) and naturalness (in rhetorical contexts).","Our problems with identifying the flowers and thorns of the Bible are abundant and complex. First, there are a number of words that could refer to a single plant, to a whole class of plants, or to both. Secondly, we try to identify the Hebrew words for plants in the Old Testament and the Greek words in the New Testament, but the analytical picture is skewed by the fact that the New Testament writers, who quoted the Old Testament frequently, used the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), not the original Hebrew. Finally, there is a very human problem: many readers of the Bible, like the tourists who visit the Holy Land, want specifics. They want to hear that this is the plant that Isaiah, or Jesus, was talking about when they said “mustard” or “lily” or “hyssop.” And, of course, some authors, like tour guides, cheerfully tell readers and tourists what they want to hear. Freshly back from his pilgrimage, a man said to me once, “Now I know what the burning bush was.” Such certainty may strengthen faith, but it is academically unsound. We therefore issue a warning here to the reader: Beware of anything in this or any other book on Bible botany that makes it sound as though we know anything about Bible plants with certainty! The best we have (and that in only a few cases) is a general consensus of scholars. In one case, that of the famous “rose of Sharon,” most scholars would say that it is probably not a rose at all! And the “lilies of the valley” may not have been lilies.","An important fact to keep in mind is that the meanings of words change over time. The time that a book of the Bible was written will determine the interpretation of the words in it. Since we don’t know the date of writing of many books, this makes it difficult to pinpoint meanings of plant names.","Before we go to the Biblical languages, we must point out a potential stumbling block in English.

The walls and doors of Solomon’s Temple were engraved with designs of “open flowers” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:18; 1 Kgs 6:29; 1 Kgs 6:32; 1 Kgs 6:35</span>). Several writers use <em>tsits</em> to picture the short life of human beings (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 14:2; Ps 103:15; Isa 28:1; Isa 40:6; Isa 40:7; Isa 40:8</span>). The verbal form (<em>tsuts</em>) is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 17:23; Isa 27:6; Ezek 7:10</span>. The Greek equivalent for this Hebrew word is <em>anthos</em>, which is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jas 1:10; Jas 1:11</span> and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Pet 1:24; 1 Pet 1:24</span> (quoting <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:6</span>). Did the writers have particular species in mind with the words <em>tsits</em> and <em>anthos</em>? We don’t know, because there are dozens of kinds of flowers that qualify. Of course, this makes it easier for translators since they free to use what is appropriate in the context, as the translators of the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> also did. This is why we find “rose of Sharon” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> in many versions.","The Hebrew word <em>nets</em> occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 40:10</span>, where the vine in the dream of Pharaoh’s butler puts forth “blossoms.” This word also occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:12</span> which speaks of “flowers” appearing on the earth at the time of singing. An abundance of red flowers appears in the spring in the land of the Bible. Interestingly, the Iraqis have a cognate word for this group of flowers (<em>nissan</em>), which, Zohary suggests, supports the proposal that the Hebrew month of Nissan has to do with the appearance of flowers. A related Hebrew noun <em>nitstah</em> is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 15:33</span>, where it refers to the blossoms of the olive tree, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 18:5</span>, where it refers to the blossoms of the grapevine. A related Hebrew verb <em>natsats</em> (“to blossom”) is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eccl 12:5; Song 6:11; Song 7:13</span>.","Mention should be made also of the Hebrew verb <em>parach</em>, which occurs fourteen times with the sense of “blossom,” and its noun form <em>perach</em>, which occurs fifteen times. One important floral reference that uses <em>perach</em> has to do with the golden lampstand in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:31; Exod 25:31; Exod 25:32; Exod 25:33; Exod 25:34; Exod 25:35; Exod 25:36; Exod 25:37; Exod 25:38; Exod 25:39; Exod 25:40</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:17; Exod 37:18; Exod 37:19; Exod 37:20; Exod 37:21; Exod 37:22; Exod 37:23; Exod 37:24</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 8:4</span>. In those passages the lampstand is compared to a flowering plant with stem and blossoms. The tips of the seven branches are described in Hebrew as <em>perach</em> and in the Septuagint as <em>krinon</em>. This suggests that to the translators of the Septuagint, the Greek word <em>krinon</em> had a general sense of “blossom-shaped object” or “flower.” On the other hand, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:26</span>, where the rim of the Temple’s great bronze water basin is described, the Hebrew text says its brim was like <em>perach shushan</em> (“blossom of <em>shushan</em> ”), and the Septuagint has <em>blastos krinou</em> (“blossom of <em>krinon</em> ”), which might suggest that both <em>shushan</em> and <em>krinon</em> designate a specific type of flower or group of flowers with curved petals (rendered “lily” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>). Further, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> <em>chavatseleth</em> and <em>shushan</em> are used in parallel, suggesting that each is specific. The issue is pertinent to the interpretation of many other verses where it is unclear if a specific flower is intended or flowers in general, for example, the phrase “lilies of the field” in the Gospels (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:28</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 12:27</span>). Matthew and Luke used the Greek word <em>krinon</em>, but it is likely that <em>krinon</em> here is generic, referring to many possible flowers, or some common flower, since there were no true lilies growing “in the fields” at that time. (The white lily grew only in forests.) A few of the species that <em>krinon</em> may have referred to are the crown anemone, scarlet crowfoot, common poppy, crown daisy, and dog chamomile.","The Greek word <em>anthos</em> is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Wis 2:7</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 24:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 39:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 50:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 51:15</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Esd 7:16</span>, where in every case but the first one the meaning is “blossom,” that is, the part of a flowering plant that has petals. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Wis 2:7</span> seems to refer to the entire flowering plant.

White lilies were and still are rare in Israel, and before 1925 many scholars were convinced that they did not exist in the Holy Land. (Two other types of lily are fairly common there.) However, many botanists now believe that <em>shushan</em> could refer to the White Lily <em>Lilium candidum</em>, at least in several contexts. This lily is also known as the Madonna lily due to its frequent association with the Virgin Mary in medieval art and poetry. Zohary believes that the Hebrew word <em>chavatseleth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> (“rose” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 35:1</span> (“crocus” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) should also be translated as “lily,” but we have reason to disagree with this.","Some scholars have suggested that the <em>shushan</em> adorning the tops of the Temple pillars in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:19; 1 Kgs 7:22</span> are white lilies, on the basis of images engraved into the capitals of columns elsewhere in the Ancient Near East. If so, then it is likely that the <em>shushan</em> used later in the same chapter (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:26</span>) to describe the downward-curving rim of the great bronze water basin outside the Temple could refer the same plant (also found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 4:5</span>). In all these cases, any type of lily would have been possible, since they all have distinctive curved petals.","The word <em>shushan</em> also occurs in Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel to refer to Susa, the capital city of Persia. Some scholars have written that this name comes from an abundance of lilies found in the area. Others hold that the name comes from “Inshushinak,” the name of the god of the city. This does not necessarily cancel out lilies as the origin of the name; it is a question of what came first.","The word <em>shushan</em> is also found in several Psalm titles (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:1; Ps 60:1; Ps 69:1; Ps 80:1</span>), where lilies are appropriate but not necessary to the thought of the passages.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 14:6</span> (5) envisions a renewed Israel that “shall blossom as the lily.”","We also find <em>shushan</em> mentioned in the Song of Songs, where the context suggests a broader range of flowers. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:16; Song 6:3</span> refer to pasturing a flock among the <em>shushan</em> in the field. The botanist Moldenke commends <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr> for using “hyacinths” here, a flower blue in color. But it could as well be the crown anemone, the common poppy, or some other flower that blankets the valleys and pastures in the springtime. The third line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 5:13</span> reads “His lips are <em>shoshanim</em>.” Some suggest that the red color is the ground of comparison here, so Ariel and Chana Bloch translate “his lips [are] red lilies.” However, as Murphy points out, “The use of the flower here may have less to do with the color of the man’s lips than with the delight they provide” (page 166).

It is found in southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It can grow annually or biennially. It grows 1–2 meters (3–7 feet) in height and has large waxy, lobed leaves with sharp spines as in other thistles. Its flower heads, one per stalk, have tiny pink or purple florets bunched together to form the flower. A chemical (silymarin) extracted from the seeds of this thistle is believed to enhance liver function. It is used to treat liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, and gallbladder disorders.

Also, the Hebrew word <em>barqan</em> could have been treated here, but we have taken it to refer to thistles (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:6.2.1\">6.2.1 Thistles</a>). Hepper suggests that <em>barqan</em> could have referred to branches of the boxthorn. The Hebrew and Greek words discussed below are usually translated “thorn,” “bramble,” or “brier” in English. The words “brier” and “bramble” have technical usages. Bramble technically refers to thorny plants in the rose family (genus <em>Rubus</em>), and it includes blackberries and raspberries, both common as food plants in Europe and North America. Brier can refer to a type of rose with pink flowers, also called the sweetbrier or eglantine, or to a prickly vine in the eastern United States called the bullbrier, greenbrier, and other names.","<em>chedeq</em>","In both references to this Hebrew word there is an association with a fence or hedge (<em>mesukah</em>). The first line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 15:19</span> says literally “The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns [<em>chedeq</em> ].” The first line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 7:4</span> says “The best of them is like a brier [<em>chedeq</em> ],” which is parallel to “the most upright of them a thorn hedge.” <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 5:5</span> mentions a vineyard with a hedge. This hedge may have been made of stones, but may well have been topped with thorny branches of spiny burnet or Christ thorn. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 2:8</span> (6) refers to God hedging the path of wayward Israel with “thorns” (<em>sirah</em>).","<em>na‘atsuts</em>","This Hebrew word occurs twice in Isaiah.

Later in the vision of the new Israel, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 55:13</span> says beautiful cypress trees will replace thornbushes (<em>na‘atsuts</em>), and fragrant myrtle shrubs will replace briers (<em>sirpad</em>).","<em>sirah</em>","Two passages where this Hebrew word occurs are <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eccl 7:6</span> (“For as the crackling of thorns [<em>sirah</em> ] under a pot …”) and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 2:8</span> (“Therefore I will hedge up her way with thorns [<em>sirah</em> ] …”).

The plural Hebrew word <em>tseninim</em> is used in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 33:55; Josh 23:13</span> in a metaphorical sense: the enemies of Israel will be like thorns in the Israelites’ bodies.","<em>qots</em>","This is probably the most general of the Hebrew words for thorn, occurring twelve times, including six times in doublets with <em>barqan</em>, <em>dardar</em>, <em>sillon</em>, or <em>shamir</em>.","<em>sek</em>","The only place we find this Hebrew word is in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 33:55</span>, where we read that the inhabitants of Canaan “will be as pricks [<em>sek</em> ] in your eyes and as thorns (<em>tseninim</em> ] in your sides.” However, several related words give us clues to the meaning of <em>sek</em>: <em>sukkah</em> refers to a harpoon in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 40:31</span>, and <em>sakkin</em> means “knife.”","<em>shayith</em>","This Hebrew word occurs seven times, always as a doublet with <em>shamir</em>, and only in Isaiah.","<em>shamir</em>","This Hebrew word occurs eight times in Isaiah with a botanical meaning, seven of which are in parallel with <em>shayith</em>. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> usually translates the doublet as “briers [<em>shamir</em> ] and thorns [<em>shayith</em> ].” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:17</span> the order of these Hebrew words is reversed, so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has “thorns and briers.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> translates <em>shamir</em> as “diamond” or “adamant,” a type of hard stone, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 3:9</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zech 7:12</span>.

In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 6:8</span> <em>akantha</em> is in a doublet again with <em>tribolos</em><em>Akantha</em> also occurs in the story of the sower (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 13:7; Matt 13:7; Matt 13:22; Mark 4:7; Mark 4:7; Mark 4:18; Luke 8:7; Luke 8:7; Luke 8:14</span>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 27:29; John 19:2</span> “a crown of thorns [<em>akantha</em> ]” is placed on Jesus’ head. Scholars have speculated for centuries over what species <em>akantha</em> refers to in these verses. Linnaeus was so convinced that it must be the Syrian Christ Thorn <em>Ziziphus spina-christi</em> that he made “Christ-thorn” the species name. Others, particularly Hebrew botanists, argue for the Spiny Burnet <em>Sarcopoterium spinosum</em> on the grounds that the soldiers would have taken the most available thorny plant. It could also have been the <em>Paliurus spina-christi</em>, the Lotus Thorn <em>Ziziphus lotus</em>, or the Boxthorn <em>Lycium shawii</em> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.2\">1.2 Boxthorn</a>). We believe that Matthew and John were not interested in the particular bush that the thorns came from, so they used a general word here.","<em>akanthinos</em>","This Greek word is derived from <em>akantha</em>. It is used of the crown of thorns in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 15:17; John 19:5</span>. It seems to be a generic word, meaning “thorny” or “made of thorns.”","<em>batos</em>","The famous burning bush in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 3:2; Exod 3:3; Exod 3:4</span> (<em>seneh</em> in Hebrew) is rendered by the Greek word <em>batos</em> in the Septuagint, and that word is used in the retelling of the story in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37; Acts 7:30; Acts 7:35</span> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.4\">1.4 Burning bush</a>). The only clue that this might have been a thorny plant is that Luke uses it in parallel with <em>akantha</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 6:44</span> b: “For figs are not gathered from thorns [<em>akantha</em> ], nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush [<em>batos</em> ].”","<em>ramnos</em>","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">EpJer 1:70</span> (71), a passage that echoes <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 10:5</span>, the Greek word <em>ramnos</em> refers to a bush that birds land on. How did the translators of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> know it was a “thorn bush”? It is possible that they used “thorn bush” for <em>ramnos</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">EpJer 1:70</span> because the Septuagint translators used <em>ramnos</em> to translate the Hebrew word for “bramble” (<em>‘atad</em>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:14; Judg 9:15</span> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.2\">1.2 Boxthorn</a>).","<em>tribolos</em>","This Greek word only occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 7:16; Heb 6:8</span>, where it is rendered “thistles.” In both passages it is paired with <em>akantha</em>.","<em>spina</em>","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">3 Macc 16:33; 3 Macc 16:78</span> the Latin word <em>spina</em> is used to refer to thorns growing on the roads of a deserted land.

In many cases doublets are involved (for example, “thorns and thistles,” “thorns and briers”) or synonyms in parallel lines. In many languages there may not be nearly as many words in the semantic domain “thorny plants” to choose from as there are in Hebrew, so translators will have to use their vocabulary more than once, trying to be concordant where possible.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:7; Judg 8:16</span>: Two problems arise in these verses. First, the identity of the plant(s) referred to and second, the meaning of the Hebrew verb rendered “flail” (<em>dush</em>). Gideon promises to punish the people of Succoth by flailing their flesh with “thorns” (<em>qots</em>) and “briers” (<em>barqan</em>). The Hebrew verb <em>dush</em> occurs elsewhere with the meaning “thresh,” “trample,” or “beat.” It is unclear here whether Gideon is simply threatening to beat the people of Succoth with thorny branches, or using a metaphor, saying, in effect, “I’m going to deal with your bodies as a farmer threshes/beats his grain at harvest time, only I will use thorny branches.” It must be remembered that threshing was and is done in many ways—by beating the grain with sticks, by having donkeys and oxen tread on it, or by dragging a sledge over it. In the development of agriculture, we can assume that beating by hand came first, followed by having animals trample the grain, and finally, the invention of the sledge, and that the verb <em>dush</em> started with the sense of “beat” and then took on the more specific meanings as the technology changed. The threshing sledge had protrusions on the underside which crushed the grain and made the outer shell come off (see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"REALIA:1.1.8.2\">1.1.8.2 Threshing board, sledge</a>). So some commentators have suggested that <em>barqan</em> here may actually refer to a sledge. However, the simplest solution is often the best, and Gideon’s threat is probably adequately translated by a verb that means “beat” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>) or “whip” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>), rather than by “trample” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>), “thresh” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>), or “flail” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Translating <em>dush</em> as “tear” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>) seems to be going beyond the normal semantic range of that word. Still, the use of “your flesh/bodies” instead of simply “you” raises the possibility that the writer intends something other than just “beat someone with a tool.” So translations following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr> also have some merit.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 5:5</span>: This verse is about God giving rich people their just reward by letting poor people inherit their wealth. The second line seems to say “they will take [the rich man’s] harvest, even from among thorns [<em>tsinnim</em>, plural of <em>tsen</em> ].” Commentators who take <em>tsinnim</em> as thorns here picture either thorny places on the edge of the field, where seed has fallen (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>; see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 13:7</span>) or perhaps a field surrounded by a thorn hedge, which was very common. In the latter case, the sense is that the poor people will even penetrate a thorny fence to take the rich man’s grain (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>).","Various commentators have considered the above situation strange, and have assumed that a word other than “thorns” was intended by the writer. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> take <em>tsinnim</em> as a plural for <em>tsinna’</em> (“basket/pannier”). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> says “carrying it off in baskets,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> has “stronger men seize it from the panniers.” “Stronger men” here results from taking the Hebrew word <em>’el</em> as “strong man” rather than as the preposition “to.” Others, using different emendations, have translated this line as “and carry away to hiding places” (Dhorme), “he takes it to the famished” (Guillaume), “or God shall take it away by blight” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, using square brackets), and “God snatches it from their mouths” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>). The Septuagint, perhaps following a different text, has “but they shall not be delivered out of calamities.” A number of commentators take this line as untranslatable and delete it. The Jewish commentator Moshe Eisemann adds this bit of explanation: The poor gleaners in the picture are not in a hurry. They take their time gleaning, even taking the grain from the thorny places or from behind thorn hedges, because they have no fear of being chased away. With this in mind, I recommend staying with “thorns” by following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> or <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֵדֶק","transliteration":"chedeq","references":["Prov 15:19","Mic 7:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"נַעֲצוּץ","transliteration":"na‘atsuts","references":["Isa 7:19","Isa 55:13"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סִירָה","transliteration":"sirah","references":["Eccl 7:6","Isa 34:13","Hos 2:8","Nah 1:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סַלּוֹן, סִלּוֹן","transliteration":"sallon/sillon","references":["Ezek 2:6","Ezek 28:24"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"צֵן, צְנִינִים","transliteration":"tsen, tseninim","references":["Num 33:55","Josh 23:13","Job 5:5","Prov 22:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קוֹץ","transliteration":"qots","references":["Gen 3:18","Exod 22:5","Judg 8:7","Judg 8:16","2 Sam 23:6","Ps 118:12","Isa 32:13","Isa 33:12","Jer 4:3","Jer 12:13","Ezek 28:24","Hos 10:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֵׂךְ","transliteration":"sek","references":["Num 33:55"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שַׁיִת","transliteration":"shayith","references":["Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שָׁמִיר","transliteration":"shamir","references":["Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4","Isa 32:13"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἄκανθα","transliteration":"akantha","references":["Matt 7:16","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:22","Matt 27:29","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:18","Luke 6:44","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:14","John 19:2","Heb 6:8","Sir 28:24"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀκάνθινος","transliteration":"akanthinos","references":["Mark 15:17","John 19:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"βάτος","transliteration":"batos","references":["Mark 12:26","Luke 6:44","Luke 20:37","Acts 7:30","Acts 7:35"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ῥάμνος","transliteration":"ramnos","references":["EpJer 1:70"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"τρίβολος","transliteration":"tribolos","references":["Matt 7:16","Heb 6:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"spina","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 16:33","3 Macc 16:78"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Prov 15:19","Mic 7:4","Isa 7:19","Isa 55:13","Eccl 7:6","Isa 34:13","Hos 2:8","Nah 1:10","Ezek 2:6","Ezek 28:24","Num 33:55","Josh 23:13","Job 5:5","Prov 22:5","Gen 3:18","Exod 22:5","Judg 8:7","Judg 8:16","2 Sam 23:6","Ps 118:12","Isa 32:13","Isa 33:12","Jer 4:3","Jer 12:13","Hos 10:8","Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4","Matt 7:16","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:22","Matt 27:29","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:18","Luke 6:44","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:14","John 19:2","Heb 6:8","Sir 28:24","Mark 15:17","John 19:5","Mark 12:26","Luke 20:37","Acts 7:30","Acts 7:35","EpJer 1:70","3 Macc 16:33","3 Macc 16:78"],"crossRefs":["FLORA:1.2","FLORA:1.4","FLORA:6.2.1","REALIA:1.1.8.2"]},{"key":"6.3","book":"flora","title":"Weeds","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"One plant name in the Bible is mentioned with no connotation of its thorniness.

Other terms not defined here may be found in a Bible dictionary.","<strong>ADVERB</strong> is a word that limits, describes, or qualifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. In English “quickly,” “soon,” “primarily,” and “very” are adverbs.","<strong>AMBIGUITY</strong> refers to words or sentences that have more than one possible meaning in a given context. For example, in the sentence “Mike said that if Joe comes, he will speak to the president,” “he” could refer to Mike or to Joe. Thus this sentence is <strong>AMBIGUOUS</strong>. Often what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since intonation and other features of speech help to make the meaning clear. In written discourse, context also helps to indicate which meaning is intended by the author.","<strong>APHRODISIAC</strong> refers to substances, often plants or parts of plants that are believed to enhance sexual desire.","<strong>APOCALYPTIC</strong> refers to a prophetic revelation concerning the end of the temporal world; for example, the book of Revelation is an apocalyptic writing.","The <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong> is a group of books included in the Greek <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> and the Old Testament of the Latin <strong>VULGATE</strong> but not in the <strong>PROTOCANON</strong> of the Hebrew canon. See also <strong>DEUTEROCANON</strong>.","<strong>ARAMAIC</strong> is a <strong>SEMITIC</strong> language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to <strong>HEBREW</strong> and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.","<strong>ARCHEOLOGY (ARCHAEOLOGICAL</strong>) refers to the study from materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text as well as the people of the days when the text was written.","<strong>AROMATIC</strong> refers to the leaves or resin of certain trees that produces a pleasing smell, such as mint, marjoram, or eucalyptus.","<strong>ARTICLE</strong> is a grammatical class of words, often obligatory, which indicate whether the word to which it is connected is definite or indefinite. In English the <strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE</strong> is “the,” and the indefinite article is “a” or “an.”","<strong>BORROWING</strong> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <strong>BORROWED</strong> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”","<strong>CALYX</strong> is the outside part of a flower, usually green in color, which forms a cup-like structure into which the petals and other parts of the flower fit. In the pomegranate, the petals drop, leaving the calyx as part of the fruit.","<strong>CHIASMUS</strong>, or <strong>CHIASTIC STRUCTURE</strong> is a reversal of words or phrases in the second part of an otherwise parallel construction; for example:","A I","B was shapen","C in iniquity","C' in sin","B' did my mother conceive","A' me.","<strong>CLASSIFIER</strong> is a term used with another term (often a proper noun) to indicate to what category the latter belongs. “Town” may serve as a classifier in the phrase “town of Bethlehem,” and “river” as a classifier in “river Jordan.”","<strong>CLAUSE</strong> is a grammatical construction, normally consisting of a subject and a predicate.","<strong>COMMON LANGUAGE VERSION</strong> uses language that is widely understood and accepted by most speakers. In such a translation, substandard speech, dialect peculiarities, and highly literary or technical terms are avoided.","<strong>CONIFERS</strong> are trees such as pine, fir, cypress, and cedar that produce seeds inside of a hard, cone-shaped structure.","<strong>CONNOTATION</strong> involves the emotional attitude of a speaker (or writer) to an expression he uses, and the emotional response of the hearers (or readers). Connotations may be good or bad, strong or weak, and they are often described in such terms as “colloquial,” “taboo,” “vulgar,” “old-fashioned,” and “intimate.”","<strong>CONSONANTS</strong> are speech sounds that are produced by blocking or restricting the passage of air as it comes from the lungs through the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called consonants; for example, “b,” “d,” “f,” “k,” or “m” in English. Consonants were originally the only spoken sounds written in the Hebrew alphabet. Marks for <strong>VOWELS</strong> were added later above or below the consonants. See also <strong>VOWELS</strong>.","<strong>CONTEXT</strong> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.","<strong>CULTURAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a kind of translation in which certain details from the culture of the source language are changed because they have no meaning or may even carry a wrong meaning for speakers of the receptor language. Cultural equivalent translation should be used only when absolutely necessary for conveying the intended meaning, and it may be important to add an explanatory note. See <strong>CULTURE</strong>.","<strong>CULTURE (CULTURAL)</strong> is the combination of beliefs, values, social institutions, customs, and material objects (such as tools or ornaments) of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.","<strong>DECIDUOUS</strong> refers to trees like oaks that drop their leaves during a cold or dry season of the year and produce a new set in the following year. They stand in contrast to “evergreen” trees, which replace leaves as they die continuously throughout the year.","<strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE</strong>. See <strong>ARTICLE</strong>.","<strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.","<strong>DEUTEROCANON (DEUTEROCANONICAL)</strong> is another term for what is referred to by some as the <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong>. These are writings that are included in the Greek <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> and the Old Testament of the Latin <strong>VULGATE</strong> but not in the <strong>PROTOCANON</strong> of the Hebrew canon.","<strong>DOMESTICATE (DOMESTICATION)</strong>, in translation, means to express a foreign word or concept in a way that makes it more like the receptor culture. For example, using “feet” and “inches” in expressing the measurements of Noah’s ark or Solomon’s Temple, rather than cubits, is “domestication.” See <strong>FOREIGNIZE</strong>.","<strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> refers to a translation that tries to give the intended meaning of the source text in a natural and meaningful way so that it produces a response in today’s reader that is essentially equivalent to that of the original reader. <strong>LITERAL</strong> translations pay more attention to reproducing the forms found in the source text. For example, RSV follows the Hebrew wording of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 104:29</span> and says: “they die and return to their dust.” CEV tries to give a dynamic equivalent translation: “they die and rot.”","<strong>EMENDATION (EMEND)</strong> is a correction of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.","<strong>EMPHASIZE</strong> means to give relative importance to an element in a discourse. Emphasis is conveyed by many different devices, depending on the language; for example, positioning of words, emphatic particles, intensifiers, or ideophones. In “Oh, that you had heeded my commandments!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 48:18</span>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>), the particle “Oh” marks this statement as emphatic.","<strong>EQUIVALENCE (EQUIVALENT)</strong> is a very close similarity in meaning or in form. See <strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> and <strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong>.","<strong>ETYMOLOGY</strong> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.","<strong>EXEGESIS (EXEGETICAL)</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct exegesis is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>EXPLICIT</strong> refers to meaning that is expressed overtly in the words of a discourse. This is in contrast to <strong>IMPLICIT</strong> information.","<strong>FAMILY</strong> in botany is a subdivision of an order in the classification of plants or trees. A family usually consists of several <strong>GENERA</strong>.","<strong>FIGURATIVE</strong> expression involves the use of words in other than their <strong>LITERAL</strong> or ordinary sense, in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by comparison or association. For example, when the psalmist says “my cup overflows,” he is not saying his cup is too full. He is rather using a figure of speech to say that he is as content as someone who has been served a generous portion. <strong>METAPHORS</strong> and <strong>SIMILES</strong> are common figures of speech.","<strong>FOREIGNIZE (FOREIGNIZATION)</strong> refers to a general translation strategy that allows cultural items such as measurements, plants, animals, and technology to remain “foreign” to the reader instead of “domesticating” them by substituting cultural equivalents in the receptor language. When a translator converts “cubits” to “meters,” “wolf” to “hyena,” or “oak” to “iroko,” he or she is “domesticating” the text. Leaving “cubits,” “wolf,” or “oak” in a translation in West Africa is foreignizing the text. See <strong>DOMESTICATE</strong>.","<strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong> is a type of translation in which many features of the source text, especially the form of the discourse, have been literally reproduced in the translation. This approach often results in an unnatural style in the receptor language, or sometimes in the lack of any meaning at all. See <strong>LITERAL</strong>.","<strong>FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE</strong> is a type of translation that attempts to convey the same set of communicative functions as that of the original source text. Some important functions of communication are to convey information, to express or evoke emotions, to promote changes in thinking or behavior, or to maintain good interpersonal relations. See also <strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong>, which has a similar meaning.","<strong>GENERAL</strong> or <strong>GENERIC</strong>, refers to a general class or kind of object. It contrasts with PARTICULAR and SPECIFIC. For example, the word “food” is a generic term, while “fruit” is more specific. However, the word “fruit” is a generic term for the more specific word “orange.”","<strong>GENUS</strong> (plural <strong>GENERA</strong>) is the usual major subdivision of a <strong>FAMILY</strong> or subfamily in the classification of organisms. A genus usually consists of more than one species.","<strong>GLOSSARY</strong> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.","<strong>GRAMMAR</strong> refers to the rules governing the formation and arrangement of elements of meaning, words, and larger constructions in a language. If a sentence is grammatical, it follows the rules of normal speech, and sounds correct to a speaker of that language.","<strong>GREEK</strong> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was spoken in the area that is today called Greece. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong>.","<strong>HEBREW</strong> is the language in which the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the <strong>SEMITIC</strong> family of languages. By the time of Christ, many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language, but spoke <strong>ARAMAIC</strong> (a language related to Hebrew) or <strong>GREEK</strong>.","<strong>IMPLICIT</strong>, or <strong>IMPLIED</strong>, refers to information that is conveyed by a text, but that is not expressed in words. The speaker assumes that the hearer understands the meaning. Often the meaning is clear from the <strong>CONTEXT</strong>. For example, when Hannah says in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:6</span> “He brings down to Sheol and raises up,” the implied or implicit meaning is “raises up to life.” See <strong>EXPLICIT</strong>.","<strong>INTERPRETATION</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct interpretation is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>LINGUISTIC</strong> refers to language, especially the formal structure of language.","<strong>LITERAL</strong> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a <strong>FIGURATIVE</strong> meaning. A literal translation is one that is very close to the forms and word order of the source language; such a translation is frequently unnatural or awkward in the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong>.","<strong>LOAN WORD</strong> is a foreign word that is used in another language, resulting from the process of <strong>BORROWING</strong>. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <strong>BORROWED</strong> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”.","<strong>MANUSCRIPTS</strong> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.","<strong>MASORETIC TEXT</strong> is the form of the text of the Hebrew Old Testament established by Hebrew scholars around the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.","<strong>MASTIC</strong> is the gum, resin, or sap that is produced by a tree when the inner bark is cut, particularly the gum from the lentisk or pistachio tree, which when it dries in lumps, it is valuable for incense.","<strong>METAPHOR</strong> is likening one object, event, or state (the “topic”) to another (the “image”) to which it is not directly or closely related in meaning. For example, when a person says “I am a worm,” he is describing his state as being lowly, miserable, or of no value. Biblical metaphors are often difficult to understand because the basis for the comparison is not always stated, as in the line “The LORD is my rock” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:2</span>). At other times either the image or the basis of comparison is unfamiliar or used differently in the receptor language. For example, when the psalmist says “He remembers that we are dust” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 103:14</span>), he is not referring to the dirt or dust on our bodies. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See <strong>SIMILE</strong>.","<strong>METONYM (METONYMIC)</strong> is a figure of speech in which a part of an object is used to indicate the entire object (for example, “one hundred head” means “one hundred cows”), or in which an object stands for another object to which it is related (for example, “the crown” can refer to the king or even the entire royal government).","<strong>MODIFY</strong> is to directly affect the meaning of another part of the sentence, as when an adjective modifies a noun or an adverb modifies a verb.","<strong>NEGEV</strong> refers to the desert area in the southern part of the Holy Land.","<strong>NONFIGURATIVE</strong> involves the use of words in their literal or ordinary sense. See <strong>FIGURATIVE</strong>.","<strong>NOUN</strong> is a word that names a person, place, thing, quality, action or idea.","<strong>OVATE</strong> refers to a leaf in the shape of an egg.","<strong>PARABLE</strong> is a short story designed to illustrate or teach some truth, religious principle, or moral lesson. Jesus often used parables to illustrate truths concerning the kingdom of God (for example, the parable of the mustard seed in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 4:30; Mark 4:31; Mark 4:32</span>).","<strong>PARALLEL (PARALLELISM)</strong> generally refers to some similarity in the content and/or form of two parts of a construction; for example, “Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world.” The structures that correspond to each other in the two statements are said to be parallel. <strong>PARALLEL PASSAGES</strong> are two or more portions of biblical text that resemble each other, often by using a series of words that are identical. For example, the Lord’s Prayer as recorded in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:9; Matt 6:10; Matt 6:11; Matt 6:12; Matt 6:13</span> has as its parallel <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:2; Luke 11:3; Luke 11:4</span>.","<strong>PARTICULAR</strong> is the opposite of <strong>GENERAL</strong>.","<strong>PASSAGE</strong> is the text of Scripture in a specific location. It is usually thought of as comprising more than one verse, but it can be a single verse or part of a verse.","<strong>PENTATEUCH</strong> refers to the first five books of the Bible, sometimes called “the Torah,” “the Law,” or “the Books of Moses.”","<strong>PHRASE</strong> is a dependent grammatical construction of two or more words, but less than a complete clause or a sentence. A phrase is usually given a name according to its main word, such as that of a noun phrase, verb phrase, or prepositional phrase. For example, “a purple coat” is a noun phrase, “behind the house” is a prepositional phrase, and “carried a heavy load” is a verb phrase.","<strong>PINNATE</strong> refers to trees or plants that have leaflets arranged on both sides of a stem, sometimes opposite each other, sometimes alternating. Such leaflets are part of what is called a “compound” leaf such as you will find on a frankincense tree.","<strong>PLURAL</strong> refers to the form of a word that indicates more than one. See <strong>SINGULAR</strong>.","<strong>POETRY (POETIC)</strong> refers to a literary genre that differs from everyday speech and from <strong>PROSE</strong> because of its rhythmic and heightened style. Poets use special language to create a mood or image to be shared with the hearer or reader. Each language has special stylistic devices such as figurative language, word order variation, wordplay, repetition or rhyming that are especially frequent in poetry (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 4:0</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 5:0</span>). The boundary between beautiful, artistic prose and poetry is sometimes difficult to determine, but speakers of a language can usually distinguish poetry from ordinary speech. Poetry is usually written or spoken in measured or balanced lines, while prose is not.","<strong>PREFIX</strong> is a part of a word that cannot stand alone and that is positioned at the beginning of the word to which it belongs; for example, “im-possible” or “re-structure.”","<strong>PROSE</strong> is the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without a special style and structure such as elaborate imagery, meter, and rhythm that are often characteristic of <strong>POETRY</strong>. However, literary prose may share some of the features of poetry, such as figures of speech, wordplay, repetition, or even parallelism.","<strong>PROTOCANON</strong> includes the Hebrew books of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament. These books are commonly accepted as canonical by both Protestants and Roman Catholics.","<strong>QUALIFY</strong> is to limit the meaning of a term by means of another term. For example, in “old man,” the term “old” qualifies the term “man.”","<strong>READ (READING)</strong> refers to the wording of a particular manuscript for a passage. Two manuscripts may have different wordings in the same passage, or two versions may have two different meanings. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 1:24</span> the Hebrew text says “three bulls,” but the Greek and Syriac versions say “a three-year-old bull.” These are different readings. See also <strong>TEXT</strong>.","<strong>RECEPTOR</strong> is the person(s) receiving a message. The <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong> is the language into which a translation is made. For example, in a translation from Hebrew into German, Hebrew is the source language and German is the receptor language.","<strong>REDUNDANT</strong> describes anything that is entirely predictable from the context. For example, in “John, he did it,” the pronoun “he” is redundant. A feature may be redundant and yet may be important to retain in certain languages, perhaps for stylistic or grammatical reasons.","<strong>RENDER</strong> means to translate or express in a language different from the original.","<strong>RENDERING</strong> is the manner in which a specific passage is translated from one language to another.","<strong>RESTRUCTURE</strong> is to rearrange the various components of a sentence or other unit of discourse in the translation process.","<strong>RHETORICAL</strong> refers to forms of speech that are employed to highlight or make more attractive some aspect of a discourse. A <strong>RHETORICAL QUESTION</strong>, for example, is not a request for information but is usually a way of making an emphatic statement.","<strong>ROOT</strong> refers to the smallest element of a word, from which other words may be derived. For example, “friend” is the root of “friendliness.” In Hebrew most roots are made up of three consonants, and many words are formed on the basis of this root. For example, the root b-r-k is the basis for the noun “blessing,” the adjective “blessed,” and the verb “to bless.”","<strong>SEMANTIC</strong> refers to meaning. Semantics is the study of the meaning of language forms. Semantic categories (or classes) group words according to their meaning (objects, events, abstracts, etc.) in contrast to grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, etc.) A <strong>SEMANTIC DOMAIN</strong> is a definable area of experience that is referred to by a set of words whose meanings are in some way related. For example, kinship terms constitute a semantic domain. Similarly, the color terms of a language may be said to form a semantic domain.","<strong>Semitic</strong> refers to a family of languages that includes <strong>Hebrew</strong>, <strong>Aramaic</strong>, and Arabic.","<strong>SENTENCE</strong> is a grammatical construction composed of one or more clauses and capable of standing alone..","<strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LXX</abbr>.","<strong>SIMILE</strong> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object (the “topic”) by comparing it to another event or object (the “image”). Similes always use words of comparison such as “like” or “as.” “Your lips [the topic] are like a scarlet thread [the image]” is a simile from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 4:3</span>. Similes differ from <strong>METAPHORS</strong> in that metaphors do not mark the image with words that indicate comparison. See <strong>METAPHOR</strong>.","<strong>SINGULAR</strong> refers to the form of a word that indicates one thing or person, in contrast to PLURAL, which indicates more than one.","<strong>SPECIFIC</strong> refers to the opposite of <strong>GENERIC</strong>.","<strong>STAMENS</strong> are long thin parts of the inside of a flower that carry pollen.","<strong>STRUCTURE</strong> is the systematic arrangement of the elements of language, including the ways in which words combine into phrases, phrases into clauses, clauses into sentences, and sentences into larger units of discourse. This process can be compared to constructing a building so structures are often spoken of as constructions. To separate and rearrange the various components of a sentence or some other unit of discourse in the translation process is to <strong>RESTRUCTURE</strong> it.","<strong>SUFFIX</strong> is a letter or one or more syllables added to the end of a word, to modify the meaning in some manner. For example, “-s” suffixed to “tree” changes the word from singular to plural, “trees,” while “-ing” suffixed to “sing” changes the verb to a participle, “singing.”","<strong>SYMBOL (SYMBOLIC)</strong> is a form, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, which is arbitrarily and conventionally associated with a particular meaning. For example, the word “cross” is a linguistic symbol, referring to a particular object. Similarly, within the Christian tradition, the cross as an object is a symbol for the death of Jesus.","<strong>SYNONYMS</strong> are words that are different in form but similar in meaning, such as “boy” and “lad.” Expressions that have essentially the same meaning are said to be <strong>SYNONYMOUS</strong>. However, no two words are completely synonymous.","<strong>SYNTAX</strong> is the selection and arrangement of words in phrases, clauses, and sentences.","<strong>SYRIAC</strong> is the name of a <strong>SEMITIC</strong> language, a part of the <strong>ARAMAIC</strong> family, used in Western Asia, into which the Bible was translated at a very early date (the <strong>Syriac version</strong>).","<strong>TARGUM</strong> is an Aramaic translation or paraphrase of a section of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.","<strong>TEXT (TEXTUAL)</strong> refers to the various Biblical manuscripts. A textual <strong>READING</strong> is the form in which words occur in a particular manuscript (or group of manuscripts), especially where it differs from others. Textual evidence is any evidence from manuscripts that may support a particular reading. <strong>TEXTUAL PROBLEMS</strong> arise when manuscripts contain different readings. These <strong>TEXTUAL VARIATIONS</strong> are readings of the same passage that differ in one or more details. An <strong>EMENDATION</strong> is a scholar’s reconstruction of what the ancient text may have been, even though no manuscript exists today to support that reconstruction. See also MANUSCRIPTS.","<strong>TRANSLATION</strong> is the transfer of a message in a source language text into another language, the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong>. A good translation aims at giving the closest natural equivalent in the receptor language in terms of meaning (content and function) and, if possible, also form (style and structure).","<strong>TRANSLITERATE (TRANSLITERATION)</strong> is to represent in the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong> the approximate sounds or letters of words occurring in the source language. Transliterating is different from <strong>TRANSLATING</strong>. For example, “Amen” in Hebrew may be transliterated in one language as “amin,” or it may be translated as “So be it.”","<strong>VERBS</strong> are a grammatical class of words that express existence, action, state, or occurrence, such as “be,” “run,” “become,” or “think.” In some languages ideas expressed by adjectives in English may be better expressed by verbs; for example, “to be hot” or “to be angry.”","<strong>VOWELS</strong> are speech sounds of the vocal cords, produced by unobstructed air passing from the lungs though the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called vowels; for example, “a,” “i,” or “u,” which are the most common vowels found in the world’s languages.
