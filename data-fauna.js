This is to be expected, since the people of Israel lived in an environment that had not been modified to any great extent by man, and the hunters among them, hunting with their simple weapons, had not reduced animal populations significantly. A certain amount of woodland was cut down for human use or burnt to create grazing land, but this would not have been very extensive. For century after century the environment would have been left virtually in its natural state.","Even in their major cities the Hebrew people were surrounded by birds, lizards, and insects, and they did not need to venture very far afield before they were among wild animals. There were herds of gazelles and antelope grazing and browsing freely in the open plains, with deer and wild pigs in the more wooded areas. In the rockier mountain areas there were ibexes and wild mountain sheep. These city dwellers also had livestock of their own, feeding in the pastures around the city, cared for by family members or hired herdsmen. They would thus all have been very familiar with the habits and behavior of both the domestic and the wild creatures.","The land in those days had, and still has, a large number of bird species, some of which were resident, while others were migrants. Many species of bird from Central Asia and Europe fly to Africa at the beginning of the northern winter. In order to avoid flying long distances over the Mediterranean Sea or the Indian Ocean, they take a land route that passes over Israel. Thus there are literally millions of birds that pass over every year, going south between late September and early November, and returning north in March and April. There are probably more migrating birds passing over Israel than any other country on earth, since this is the only place in the world where three continents meet. Many of them stay for a few weeks in Israel, regaining their strength before they move on again. As a result they are well known to the local people. This would have been true also in biblical times."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Identifying the Biblical Animals and Birds</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Translating the Hebrew and Greek names of the animals and birds of the Bible is very difficult. There is doubt about the meaning of many of the animal names. Even greater doubt exists about the meaning of most bird names, as can be seen from a comparison of Bible translations. It is rare indeed that they will agree or that the same bird name will be translated the same way each time.","In the light of this problem, the author of this Handbook has tried to apply a uniform methodology for each section of the book. First, there has been a study of archaeological and other evidence, and a careful attempt has been made to ascertain which animals, birds, and other creatures are most likely to have been found in Egypt and the land of Israel in biblical times. Then, on the basis of the biblical contexts in which the creature’s name occurs, and in the light of what is known about the meaning of the verb root from which the name is derived, an attempt has been made to match the most likely creature with the given contexts.","The results of this method should not be taken as the last word on the subject but should be seen as either a) support for one or more existing translations, or b) yet another plausible option from which to choose.","In addition to the above problems, a further problem is that the English names for some of the birds differ from place to place. For example, the eagle known in books published in Britain, Israel, and East Africa as the short-toed eagle is known as the black-breasted snake-eagle in books published in the U.S.A. and southern Africa. For this reason the scientific names are also given along with the popular names. Occasionally there are even alternate scientific names, and in these cases both are given. The scientific names are used universally in bird books, regardless of the language of publication.","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table-classification_en\">[Image: fauna-table-classification_en]</span>Zoologists use a universally accepted system of classifying animals. This handbook makes frequent use of terms in this classification system. In some places, where scientific precision is not a factor, other terms such as “types” or “varieties” may appear. The following is a table of major classification categories, or ranks, in descending order of size. Ranks appearing in BOLD TYPEFACE are defined in the glossary."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Translating the Words for the Biblical Creatures</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Translators are advised to obtain the best available field guides for the animals and birds of their area; from this they should try to find the nearest local equivalents. Even where these books are in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German, the pictures, the descriptions, and the scientific names will help to identify the animals or birds, and then the vernacular name, if any, can be found. In some field guides in Africa, such as the excellent <em>Roberts’ Birds of Southern Africa</em>, an attempt has been made to provide some of the names in local languages. These vernacular names should be carefully checked on the basis of the pictures and descriptions, and the translators should find out what most people in the language community call the birds. It is likely that there are often regional differences in the vocabulary for birds.","Finding a local equivalent will in many cases be difficult for translators in the Americas, the Far East, and Australasia, especially for the birds, since most of the biblical birds are either found only in the lands of the Bible, or they migrate between Europe or Central Asia and Africa but are not found further afield. The translator will always have the following options:","1. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the same creature.","2. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the most similar local creature, paying attention to the special symbolic importance the biblical or local animal may have.","3. Translate the word for a specific animal with a more generic word. Thus, for instance, where bears are not known, an expression like “a big fierce animal” with a footnote could substitute in some contexts.","4. Translate the biblical word with a word borrowed from a well-known trade or international language that refers to the biblical creature, and include a description of the creature in a glossary or short dictionary at the end of your Bible.","Of these options the first one is the best solution, but it will only be possible, of course, where the animal mentioned in the Bible is well known locally. Even in these cases, however, the translator needs to be careful, especially where the animal is referred to in the Bible in a figurative expression or metaphor. The significance in the biblical culture may be very different from its significance in the local culture. As an example, to the Hebrew writers the hyena signified death, ruin, and the desolation that results from being utterly defeated in war. But in some African cultures the hyena is associated with witches. In these cultures to say “Your land will become the dwelling place of hyenas” implies that your land will be taken over by witches. This is not the implication intended by a Hebrew writer using exactly the same expression.","Similarly, in many parts of Asia a dragon symbolizes good fortune and prosperity, but in the Bible it symbolizes evil and wickedness. In cases like these the translator will need to add a footnote to clarify the intended implication for the reader.","The second option is also often a good solution, provided that the local animal and the biblical animal share enough important similarities. Again the implications of using the substitute in figurative expressions should be carefully checked. It is important to avoid giving the wrong impression about the type of climate and landscape that existed in Israel in the choice of a local substitute. For instance, if “water buffalo” is substituted for “wild ox,” and “tiger” is substituted for “lion,” the reader automatically pictures Israel as a land of monsoon rain forest. It may be necessary in such cases to add a footnote indicating that the original text actually refers to different animals similar to those mentioned in the translation.","If the translator opts to use a generic expression where the original refers to a specific animal or bird (option 3), care should again be taken to recreate the correct implications in cases where the animal is referred to in a figurative expression. This can often be done by adding an adjective or a descriptive phrase. For instance, where jackals are not known but dogs are, “wild dog” may be the best local equivalent, but it would not carry the right implication in many contexts. However, a phrase like “wild dog of doom” may recreate the intended implication. Such “additions” are entirely justified, since the implication is clearly intended in the original text.","In the case where borrowed words are used in the translation (option 4), the word should always be explained in a glossary at the end of the Bible. Care should also be taken to spell the borrowed word in a way that readers will be able to pronounce easily. If readers stumble and hesitate when reading these borrowed words, this is an indication that the transliteration needs improving at this point."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Special Features of this Handbook</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In spite of the importance of animals in the Bible, it is very confusing for many translators and Bible students to compare various Bible translations and discover that when it comes to the names of animals and birds, the versions hardly ever agree. For example, if the list of unclean birds in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:13–Lev 11:19</span> is compared in different versions, it can be seen that what the Revised Standard Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) calls an “ibis” the New English Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>) calls a “screech owl,” the Jerusalem Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>) a “cormorant,” and the New International Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) a “great owl.” In fact there are no two English versions in which the list is identical.","This all stems from the fact that many of the ancient Hebrew words for animals, birds, insects, and reptiles cannot be associated with a particular creature with any certainty. At best the commentators and translators can only make their best, educated guesses.","Even the scholars face problems. Many of them are experts in Hebrew and Greek, or in other ancient languages of the Middle East, but they have very little expertise when it comes to the study of animals, birds, and so forth. As a result, in some versions the text is made to refer to animals that never existed in Bible lands. Alternatively they may know all about the animals and birds of the region but have only a slight knowledge of biblical Hebrew and Greek.","This Handbook is designed to provide the Bible student with a better foundation on which to base interpretations of these problematic words. The zoological, linguistic, and archaeological facts have been studied in great detail (including all of the biblical contexts in which the words occur). The results of this study are summarized here, with an attempt to guide the student or translator to what we consider to be the most probable interpretation. Sometimes this involves not only the interpretation of a word for a particular animal, but also the interpretation of statements that are made about that animal in the Bible.","The book is divided into the following chapters:"]},{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Within each chapter the animals are arranged in alphabetical order according to their names. Separate treatment is given to each of the creatures, even to those mentioned only once. To make things as useful as possible for the student/translator, each entry is arranged identically. The heading of the entry is based on the English name or names for the creature that is suggested by the author. This may not be the same name that appears in the English Bible version that the student or translator is using. In cases where there does not seem to be an entry on the animal you wish to study, go to the index l of Animals, and you will find it listed there. Alternatively, you can turn to the index of Scripture References. If you then go to the page number given in the index, you will find some discussion about the creature you are looking for.","As a general rule, there is at least one Bible version and a group of scholars that support the author’s recommended translation, but in one or two cases the only support for the recommendation comes from some scholars but not from any current version of the English Bible. In all cases this is clearly indicated in the text.","We hope that this Handbook will prove to be both helpful and interesting to all who read it. At times it has been necessary to use language that is fairly technical, but an attempt has been made to include in parentheses the more common, but slightly less precise, expressions."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"1","book":"fauna","title":"Animals, general","depth":0,"indexItems":[{"target":"FAUNA:1.1","label":"1.1 Domestic animals, cattle, livestock, animal, living being","text":"1.1 Domestic animals, cattle, livestock, animal, living being"},{"target":"FAUNA:1.2","label":"1.2 Animals that are ridden or made to carry loads","text":"1.2 Animals that are ridden or made to carry loads"},{"target":"FAUNA:1.3","label":"1.3 Wild or dangerous animals","text":"1.3 Wild or dangerous animals"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"A number of words in the Bible indicate “animals” or “creatures” in a general way without specifying a particular species.

this type would have been familiar to the people of the period.

The best choice is a generic word for “bear” rather than the specific word for a type of bear.

In parts of mainland Asia where the brown bear is not known, the word for the Himalayan Black Bear <em>Selenarctos thibetanus</em> is the best choice. The word for the sloth bear of India and Ceylon, or for the sun and moon bears of Malaysia, Indo-China, and Indonesia should be avoided, since these bears have small teeth and are not dangerous.","In the higher parts of South America the word for the Spectacled Bear <em>Tremarctos ornatus</em> can be used if this animal is known to the readers. For translators elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, the problem is more difficult, especially in areas where bears are not known. The use of the name for a local animal is seldom successful, since the more dangerous local animals are usually too different from bears.

They argue that roe deer while being fairly common in biblical times live singly or in pairs for part of the year but not in herds they are extremely shy and difficult to hunt as they live in thick undergrowth and seldom leave it. They are rarely even seen in areas where they live. Thus the argument goes it would have been almost impossible for large numbers of roe deer to have been brought to Solomon’s table on a daily basis as recorded in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:23</span>.

In Egypt and to a lesser extent in Sinai the bubal hartebeest was depicted in murals and stone carvings and many mummified hartebeests have also been found in Egyptian sites. Both Canaanite and Israelite archeological sites have yielded hartebeest bones in fairly large quantities. They have even been found in close proximity to Canaanite altars suggesting that the Canaanites sacrificed them.","The Hebrew name <em>yachmur</em> is probably derived from a root <em>ch-m-r</em>, which means “red” and is the same root from which the Hebrew name for a donkey is derived. The bubal hartebeest is both red and remarkably like a horned donkey. It is also known as the red hartebeest. The word “hartebeest” is a word borrowed from Dutch and literally means “deer-cow\".","Interestingly, the Septuagint translates <em>yachmur</em> as <em>bubalos</em> “water buffalo\", which was an animal well known to the Israelites. Water buffalo were domesticated in Babylonia and Syria and were found in the marshes of northern Israel around Lake Huleh. However this translation has no support among modern scholars. The name bubal in bubal hartebeest is derived from this same Greek word."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Roe Deer <em>capreolus capreolus</em> are small deer, the adult males having short horns that have three prongs.

Before 1960 it was thought that domestic camels were not in use in Egypt until around 1300 B.C. The evidence used in this argument was the fact that no hieroglyphs (pictures representing words) for camels or illustrations of camels seem to have been in use before that time.","However since then a limestone carving of a loaded camel and some line drawings scratched in stone have been found all dated by archeologists as coming from a period around 3000 B.C. Many camel bones from the period 1800-1600 B.C. have also been uncovered in ancient town sites and a camel hair cord dated about 2500 B.C. was found in Faiyum near Cairo. This new evidence has led scholars to conclude that domestic camels were indeed in use since about 3000 B.C. but that taboos associated with them may have been responsible for the fact that they were not depicted in hieroglyphs on commemorative stones or tomb decorations and that camel figurines were not made before 1550 B.C.","Whether or not these scholars are correct in their conclusions there is no doubt that the Hebrew text as we have it contains the word for “camel\", and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 12:16</span> has to be translated accordingly.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0052_bactrian\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0052_bactrian.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0052_bactrian\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Camel — Bactrian camel</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-2694771/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0052_bactrian.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>There were two types of camel known in Bible times the most common being the Arabian Dromedary <em>camelus dromedarius</em>, which was indigenous to the area.

Bactrian camels may reach a height of about two meters (6.5 feet), while dromedaries are even bigger. Dromedaries are a uniform light fawn color, while Bactrian camels are darker, especially in winter when they grow longer fur.","Camels do not have hooves but a large footpad with two broad toes ideally suited to walking on sand. In other ways too they are ideally suited to life in desert areas. They store excess food in their humps and this makes it possible for them to go a long time without eating. Special blood cells also enable them to go without water for long periods. They also have a very efficient digestive system and can extract the maximum amount of nutrition from apparently dry vegetation. This adaptation to harsh environments means that camels can make long journeys through dry areas which would be beyond the abilities of other types of pack animal such as donkeys. Camels were used for riding and for carrying heavy loads. They were also used to pull carts.","In winter the fur of camels thickens and grows longer and then when summer comes they shed their winter fur in large wads. These wads of camel hair are collected and twisted into cords and ropes or spun into thread which is then used for weaving coarse cloth. This cloth was usually used for making tents but it was sometimes used for making outer robes.","Camels’ milk was used as food and drink but their meat was considered unclean by the Israelites."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In spite of the fact that camels were considered to be unclean for food they were a symbol of wealth and commerce.

However, in some languages descriptive names have been invented. In some South American languages names meaning “hump-backed llama” or “big alpaca with a hump” have been used. Elsewhere expressions such as “hump-backed horse” have been used. A fuller description should usually be included in a glossary or word list.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 32:15</span>: Here the reference is to female camels that are providing milk, and the expression is often translated as “thirty camels for milking\", or “thirty mother camels giving milk\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span>: Although the word <em>beker</em> is probably related to the Hebrew root <em>B-K-R</em> meaning “early” or “the first\", the usage in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span> seems not to place any special emphasis on the youth of the camels, but perhaps on their superior quality. The word is used to provide a qualifying synonym (a word having basically the same meaning) for “camel” in order to complete a poetic couplet. The English word “dromedary” has this same function in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>.","In languages that have two words for camel, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span> the usual word for camel can be used in the first part of the couplet and the lesser known word can be used for <em>beker</em> in the parallel line of the poem. However, in languages with only one word for camel, or in languages in which a borrowed or made-up word is used, it is better to use the usual word for camel in the first line of the couplet and then use a suitable qualifying expression to complete the couplet; for example:","Camel caravans will cover the land,","The best camels from Midian and Ephah;","And from Sheba . . . .","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 2:23</span> the context clearly indicates that <em>bikrah</em> refers to a female camel ready for mating, that is, “in heat\". The word translated “wild” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> is better translated “berserk” (compare “frantic” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>).

In the context, which depicts people coming from distant foreign lands, the reference may be to Bactrian camels from Central Asia. In most languages the normal word for camel can be used in this verse. In languages that have different markers for pack animals and animals for riding, the word for camel in this verse can be marked as “camel for riding\". Where Bactrian camels are known, the word for this type of camel can be used here.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 19:24; Matt 23:24; Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25</span>: In these passages the large size of the camel is contrasted with a small eye of a needle in the one case, and with a small mosquito in the other. In some languages where camels are not well known, translators have used the name of a better known large animal, such as “bull\", “horse\", or “elephant\", in order to retain the impact of Jesus’ words for the local readers. In such cases it is necessary to use a footnote to the effect that the Greek text has “camel\".

It seems likely that in Africa the African Wild Cat <em>felis lybica</em> in its search for mice and rats began to inhabit granaries and was finally coaxed into people’s homes by feeding it scraps of meat. These earliest domestic cats were kept not simply as pets but for the control of the rodents. In Egypt the goddess Basht was given the cat as her symbol and she is usually depicted as having a cat’s head. Cats were also mummified and buried with important people. Basht was the divinity believed to inhabit and govern the region east of the Nile which is where the Israelites lived from the time of Joseph to the time of the Exodus. These associations of the cat with Basht probably explain why there is no mention of cats in the protocanonical books of the Bible and the only time cats are mentioned in the deuterocanonical books is in relation to Babylonian temples.","In the centuries following the domestication of the cat the domestic Libyan cat was adopted by neighboring nations and soon domestic cats were found as far away as India. Wherever the domestic cat was kept it interbred with local wild cats resulting in the many variants now found. The cat referred to in the Letter of Jeremiah (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">EpJer 1:21</span>) may have been the African wild cat (which was found wild even far to the east of Babylonia) or another local wild cat such as the European Wild Cat <em>Felis sylvestris</em>. In ancient times wild cats were considered to be beneficial since they kept down the rat population and thus offered some protection for crops and granaries. As a result wild cats were probably common in towns and villages.

and breeding among the Hebrews are first mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 12:16</span>, when Abram is given cattle by the king of Egypt and brings them back to Canaan. From this time on cattle formed an important element in Hebrew life and culture, although ownership of cattle was limited to relatively wealthy people. The area of Gilead in particular, became known for the number and the quality of cattle there (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 32:1; Num 32:4; 1 Chr 5:9</span>).","<em>English terminology</em>","For the sake of readers who are not mother tongue speakers of English it seems best to clarify the rather bewildering variety of collective terms for cattle. Even mother tongue speakers sometimes have difficulties with these.","<strong>Cattle</strong>: This word in modern English is a plural form but there is no singular or countable form of the word. So when referring to a specific number of animals of this kind one has either to use expressions such as “five head of cattle” or to specify the gender of the animals in expressions such as “four cows and one bull.” In an earlier form of English the word meant “possessions” then it came to mean “livestock” and finally in modern English it is a more specific word referring collectively to any domestic cow-like animals whether they be cows, bulls, oxen, calves, bullocks, steers, or heifers.","<strong>Cows and Bulls</strong>: Although cows are strictly speaking adult female cattle the word in modern English is sometimes used to mean “cattle” without reference to gender especially when using numbers. Thus “400 cows” can mean “400 head of cattle.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> sometimes uses the word in this sense. The word for adult male cattle, “bulls\", is never used with this more general meaning.","<strong>Oxen</strong>: In modern English this word refers to bulls that have been castrated in order to make them more docile so that they can be used as work animals. The effects of castration were discovered very soon after cattle were first domesticated and although the Jews were forbidden to castrate animals they seem to have obtained such animals from gentile neighbors or ignored the prohibition.","A more archaic usage of the English “oxen” has the general meaning of “cattle\". This archaic usage is preserved in words such as “oxgoat\", “oxtail\", or “wild oxen\", where the gender of the animals is not a component of the meaning. It is this archaic general sense in which most English versions use the word especially when quantifying. Thus in these versions “400 oxen” means “400 head of cattle” not “400 castrated bulls.” This is the reason why we find reference to oxen being sacrificed even though there is a specific prohibition against sacrificing animals that have been castrated.","<strong>Steers</strong>: These are castrated bulls that are raised for slaughtering not for work.","<strong>Bullocks</strong>: This word generally means young bulls but in some dialects of English such as Australian it can also mean the same as “oxen” or “steers\", that is, castrated bulls.","<strong>Heifers</strong>: This is the word used for young cows that have not yet given birth to their first calf.","<strong>Calves</strong>: These are young cattle of either sex.","<em>Dairy products</em>","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0159_cows\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0159_cows.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0159_cows\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Cow — Cows during summer grazing in Upper Galilee, with Mt.

However because of the climate in which they lived and the way in which milk was stored in goatskin bags the milk did not stay fresh very long. They probably drank sour milk as do most other nomadic herding societies. When sour milk is shaken lumps called “curds” separate from the rest of the milk which then becomes a thin and watery liquid called “whey\". The curds can be eaten as they are and this is what is often translated as “butter” in English versions. It is not, however, what is normally called butter in the modern world. The curds can also be packed together salted and dried in flat cakes. This is what is referred to as “cheese” in most English versions.

When used of animals it may refer to war-horses or to bulls. The context usually, but not always, gives the clue as to which sense is meant. The contexts in which bulls are meant unambiguously are <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 50:13; Ps 68:31</span>; and probably <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 50:11</span>, although in the latter verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translate the word as “stallions\". The parallelism is better retained by translating “grazing heifer in heat” and “bellowing bull” rather than “neighing stallion” in the second line.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:7</span> is an interesting case. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering “bison” can be discounted. For one thing to translate like this turns a prophecy of doom into a prophecy about a hunting expedition, which is highly unlikely; but perhaps even more serious, there is no evidence at all that the European bison, also known as the Wisent <em>Bison bonasus</em>, was ever found anywhere near as far south as Edom.","The poetry in this verse plays on the fact that <em>’abir</em> can refer to people as well as to bulls. The poem speaks of a sacrifice being prepared by Yahweh, and then, by using an ambiguous expression for the sacrificial animals, the inference is that people, not animals, are to be killed. This is reflected well in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> translations. The poetic verse means something like:","Like wild oxen, they themselves will fall dead,","Like sacrificial bulls (parim), their mighty men.","<em>’aluf, ’elef</em>: These words are probably related to the root <em>’a-l-f-</em>, to teach or train. Thus ’aluf/’elef indicates tame or domesticated animals. A general word for “cattle” is recommended.","<em>Behemah</em> usually means “animal\", “domestic animal\", or “livestock\". In the passages listed above, it should be translated “cattle\". See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:1\">1 Animals, general</a>.","<em>Baqar</em> is the most general word for “cattle\". In its widest usage it basically means “herds” and may include sheep and goats, but always includes cattle. Often it means only cattle and is used in contrast to sheep and goats. In some contexts, where <em>baqar</em> are referred to as having given birth, it is clear that only cows are meant.","In translating <em>baqar</em> translators should first determine whether the context refers to livestock in general, or to cattle specifically, and translate accordingly. Generally when an English translation has “herds” without specifying which animals are meant, the meaning of <em>baqar</em> is “livestock” or “domestic animals” in general. If the reference is to cattle, use a general word. In languages where there are many words for cattle, depending on gender, age, color, breed, and other things, the most all-inclusive word for cattle should be used, except when a specific context indicates otherwise, such as <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 22:19</span>, where bulls are obviously meant.","<em>Meri’</em> refers to a stall-fed animal, usually a calf, that is reserved for sacrifice. It is best translated “stall-fed calf\", “fattened calf\", or “choice calf.” The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> translation “buffalo\", comes from a comparison with similar words in other Semitic languages which might mean “buffalo,” but this is not widely accepted by commentators since similar words in related languages often have different meanings. For instance the English “deer” and the German “Tier” are related, but have different meanings (the German word means “animal\"). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 11:6</span> the Masoretic Text includes “and a fatted calf” but the Septuagint and the Vulgate follow a different text, and thus most modern versions do not include this phrase.","<em>‘egel</em> and <em>‘eglah</em> indicate male and female calves (heifers) respectively. These words are also used for the images of calves worshiped by the Canaanites. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> make this clear in the book of Hosea by translating the words as “calf-gods” and “calf-idols\". Most such contexts are self-evident, but <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 10:5</span> is one reference to calf-idols which most versions do not adequately identify. See, however, the New Century Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>) with the “calf-shaped idol\". <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders “idols” and adds a footnote: “The Hebrew text has ‘calves,’ referring to the idols made in the shape of calves.","<em>Par</em> refers specifically to young bulls reserved for sacrifice. Some commentators deduce that these are firstborn bulls; others believe that the bulls were especially fattened. This latter position is reflected in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> translation of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 6:25</span>. It is likely that both positions are correct. The age of the sacrificial bull varied from one year to three years and older, so the translation “calf” is a little misleading. <em>Par</em> is best translated by a phrase meaning “sacrificial bull” the first time it appears in a paragraph, and then simply bull thereafter in the paragraph.","<em>parah</em> is the feminine form of <em>par</em> and refers specifically to young cows specially fattened and reserved for sacrifice. The translation heifer is unwarranted, since in many contexts <em>parah</em> is used for a cow that has a calf. <em>parah</em>, then, is best translated simply as cow, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 4:1</span> fat cows is warranted. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 4:16</span> <em>parah</em> is used in a simile for stubbornness. This is possibly a reference to the fact that a cow that has been stall-fed for all of its life would be reluctant to move very far from its stall. It would thus probably be difficult to move when the time came to make the journey to Jerusalem for its sacrifice. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> uses “mule” in this verse, since this is the animal that is famed for stubbornness in English culture. If cows are not considered to be stubborn animals in the translator’s culture, a similar substitution can be made, if the substituted animal is one likely to have been known by the people of Bible times. It is not advisable to use a word like water buffalo since this brings with it the inference that Israel was an area of heavy rainfall.","<em>shor</em> is a general word for individual cattle. They may be male, female, or both (as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> sometimes indicates in a footnote when translating the word as “ox\"), and only the context can indicate which gender is meant. <em>shor</em> presents a problem to English translators because English has no countable equivalent. We have to use forms that specify the gender. The most common translation of this word in English is “ox\", but this is in the archaic sense of “head of cattle” and does not indicate the gender of the animal, nor whether or not it has been castrated. Some modern versions use “cow” in this same genderless sense. In other languages where there is a word for individual cows, oxen, or bulls without reference to gender, this word should be used for <em>shor</em>. If, as in English, gender has to be specified, the context can usually guide in the choice. In cases where the gender is not determined by the context, a general plural word for cattle can be used.","<em>Tor</em> is the general Aramaic word for cattle. In English the problem of quantifying results in “young bulls” being used in the Ezra passages, and “ox” in the Daniel passages. In Ezra the meaning is cattle for sacrifices, while in Daniel the reference is to cattle generally.","<em>Bous</em> is the usual Greek word for cattle, male or female. In translation a general word that may refer to a bull or a cow is the best equivalent. In John the animals driven from the Temple definitely were not “oxen” in the technical meaning of castrated bulls.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 22:4</span>: The word <em>sitistos</em> indicates stall-fed cattle that are being fattened for slaughter.","<em>Tauros</em> is the usual word for “bull\". English versions vary between “ox” and “bull\", but there really is no difference in meaning between the various contexts in the New Testament. It is recommended that translators use a word meaning “bull” throughout. Bulls were used for feasting and sacrifice (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 22:4; Heb 9:13; Heb 10:4</span>). The Greeks associated bulls (not oxen) with the gods (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 14:13</span>).","<em>Moschos</em> is the word for a male calf or bull-calf. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 7:41</span> a verb derived from <em>moschos</em>, meaning “make a bull-calf\", is used.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 9:13</span>: A word or phrase for a female calf (heifer) is the best equivalent.

deer (family <em>cervidae</em>) in Canaan the Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>, the Red Deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em>, and the Roe Deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em>. Of these the red deer disappeared very early before the time of the Exodus and the roe deer was confined to thick bush in remote valleys and so was probably seldom seen. Thus the fallow deer would have been the most common. It roamed wild and was also probably kept in deer parks in the days of King Solomon.","The Hebrew term <em>’ayal</em> was probably a general term for deer and for the male fallow deer in particular. <em>’Ayalah</em> and <em>’ayelet</em> are the female forms.","At the time when <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> was produced deer hunting was a very popular pastime and a number of specialized words were used to refer to deer in their different stages of development. Young male deer were called successively: knobbers - brockets - spayads - staggards - harts - stags. The English word “hart” thus actually refers to a male red deer in its fifth year when a “royal” prong forms on its antler. The word “stag” refers to the male red deer (usually the dominant male of a herd) after its sixth year when a “crown” of three prongs forms at the very top of its antlers. “Hind” refers to the female red deer of three years and upward. “Buck” refers to the male fallow deer or the male roe deer and “doe” to the females of these. This usage is reflected in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> versions.","In modern English outside of deer-hunting circles most types of deer of either sex are called simply “deer” but if the sex is differentiated in most of the English-speaking world “stag” is usually used for the male and “doe” for the female; however, in the U.S.A. the males are called “bucks.” Young deer are often called “fawns.\""]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Deer differ from antelopes in that the males drop their antlers (horns) every year, while antelopes do not.

In summer they have a reddish fur with white spots and in the winter this coat becomes darker and the spots disappear. The bucks begin to grow antlers (branching horns) in the second year. This is at first a short unbranched prong. Each year the antlers are shed at the beginning of spring. In the third year branched antlers appear with two simple branches facing forward and the main branch growing upward. In subsequent years this main branch grows bigger flattens out and develops numerous sharp points along the edge. Eventually at the end of the fifth year each antler is double the width of the human hand in places and about 70 centimeters (2 feet) in length.","Mating takes place in autumn when the bucks utter hoarse bellowing roars.

If no generic words exist but the fallow deer is known, the word for this deer should be chosen. In other parts of the world where deer are found, if a specific rather than a generic word has to be used, the word for a large type of deer is preferable, such as the sambar deer (of India, Burma, Thailand, and western China) or the elk of North America.","Since surefootedness is not associated with deer in some parts of the world, a phrase such as “surefooted as a deer” should be used in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 22:34</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:33</span>, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hab 3:19</span> or a local animal known for its surefootedness could be substituted (see the discussion below).","In Africa, where the only deer are very small forest dwellers, it is better to use a term for an antelope that lives in herds, such as the impala, when there is a literal reference to deer. In passages where there is figurative usage, however, there is a little more leeway. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 42:1</span> for instance it would be legitimate to use the word for a local large antelope known to need water regularly, such as the wildebeest or impala. Similarly in the passages referred to above, where “surefootedness on high places” is the theme, the word for a local cliff-dwelling antelope such as the Klipspringer <em>Oreotragus oreotragus</em> or Chamois <em>Rupicapra rupicapra</em> would be legitimate. In all these cases a footnote could indicate that the Hebrew refers to a deer, although this is not strictly necessary. It is to be noted that in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 42:1</span>, while the masculine form <em>’ayal</em> is used, the corresponding verb is feminine. Where a language distinguishes between genders, it is recommended that a word be used indicating a female animal.","In the Hebrew text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:21</span> there are a number of problems. The combination of words used with the noun <em>’ayalah</em> is rather strange, since the sentence with the vowels of the Masoretic Text is literally “Naphtali is a female deer that has been sent/set free, which gives a beautiful word.” The verb “sent” is usually used of sending messengers, and the expression “a beautiful word” reinforces this possibility. The sentence could conceivably mean “Naphtali is like a deer sent out as a messenger to give beautiful news.” The point of comparison would be the speed of the deer, that is, it would describe Naphtali as a speedy messenger, which is rather strange. No major translation has ever adopted this interpretation.","Many translations have adopted the interpretation “Naphtali is a deer set free, which produces beautiful fawns” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), but this involves a very debatable emendation of the word meaning “word” or “utterance\". The point of comparison would be enjoyment of freedom on the one hand and fertility on the other. It is likely that the Masoretic Hebrew text has been corrupted at some point, and that the Greek of the Septuagint represents an earlier form of the text: “Naphtali is a spreading terebinth tree that puts forth a lovely canopy” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, and footnotes in most other versions). This translation is based on a reading of <em>’elah</em> instead of <em>’ayalah</em>. The point of comparison for both metaphors would be prosperity and fertility. A similar problem exists in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 29:9</span>, where the reading should probably be <em>’elah</em>, “terebinth tree\", rather than <em>’ayalah</em>.","In parts of the world where neither deer nor antelope are found, borrowed terms may have to be used, but these should be described in a glossary."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיָּל","transliteration":"’ayal","references":["Deut 12:15","Deut 12:22","Deut 14:5","Deut 15:22","1 Kgs 5:3","Ps 42:2","Song 2:9","Song 2:17","Song 8:14","Isa 35:6","Lam 1:6"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיָּלָה, אַיֶּלֶת","transliteration":"’ayalah, ’ayelet","references":["Gen 49:21","2 Sam 22:34","Job 39:1","Ps 18:34","Ps 22:1","Ps 29:9","Prov 5:19","Song 2:7","Song 3:5","Jer 14:5","Hab 3:19"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Deut 12:15","Deut 12:22","Deut 14:5","Deut 15:22","1 Kgs 5:3","Ps 42:2","Song 2:9","Song 2:17","Song 8:14","Isa 35:6","Lam 1:6","Gen 49:21","2 Sam 22:34","Job 39:1","Ps 18:34","Ps 22:1","Ps 29:9","Prov 5:19","Song 2:7","Song 3:5","Jer 14:5","Hab 3:19"],"crossRefs":["FAUNA:2.7"]},{"key":"2.12","book":"fauna","title":"Dog","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"כֶּלֶב","transliteration":"kelev","references":["Exod 11:7","Exod 22:30","Deut 23:19","Judg 7:5","1 Sam 17:43","1 Sam 24:15","2 Sam 3:8","2 Sam 9:8","2 Sam 16:9","1 Kgs 14:11","1 Kgs 16:4","1 Kgs 21:19","1 Kgs 21:19","1 Kgs 21:23","1 Kgs 21:24","1 Kgs 22:38","2 Kgs 8:13","2 Kgs 9:10","2 Kgs 9:36","Job 30:1","Ps 22:17","Ps 22:21","Ps 59:7","Ps 59:15","Ps 68:24","Prov 26:11","Prov 26:17","Eccl 9:4","Isa 56:10","Isa 56:11","Isa 66:3","Jer 15:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κύων","transliteration":"kuōn","references":["Matt 7:6","Luke 16:21","Phil 3:2","2 Pet 2:22","Rev 22:15","Tob 5:17","Tob 11:4","Jdt 11:19","Sir 13:18"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κυνάριον","transliteration":"kunarion","references":["Matt 15:26","Matt 15:27","Mark 7:27","Mark 7:28"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Discussion and description:","headingHtml":"Discussion and description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0184_dogs\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0184_dogs.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0184_dogs\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Dog — A pack of dogs roaming in the Judean hills</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Feral_dogs_in_palestine.JPG • © محمد الفلسطيني, CC BY-SA 3.0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0184_dogs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Dogs were domesticated very early and were used for hunting and as watchdogs in the ancient world.

This habit of scavenging and the fact that dogs were possibly associated with some Egyptian gods meant that dogs were seen as very unclean animals by the Jews. The dog found in Jewish settlements in Bible times was probably the pariah dog <em>Canis familiaris putiatini</em> which looked something like a small light brown Alsatian or German shepherd. This type of dog in its wild and domesticated forms is found all over the Middle East and on the mainland coasts of South and Southeast Asia (where it is known as the crab-eating dog). The Australian dingo is also very similar.","Small pet dogs were kept in homes in the Greek and Roman civilizations by gentiles but not by Jews.

Furthermore the dog was possibly one of the symbols of the Egyptian god Anubis (although many modern scholars believe the symbol to be the jackal).","With all of the above in mind it is understandable that dying and then being eaten by unclean dogs was seen as the worst of all possible fates.","In the first century A.D. gentiles were considered to be unclean and were referred to by Jews in a derogatory way as “dogs.” There is therefore strong irony in the expression in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Phil 3:2</span> where Judaizing Christians are referred to as dogs.","One additional connotation associated with dogs in the Bible is sexual perversion and promiscuity a connotation probably arising from the fact that sexually aroused male dogs do not always differentiate between sexes as they seek to mate and the fact that dogs of both sexes mate repeatedly with different partners."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 11:7</span> the literal expression “Not a dog shall move its tongue” means that not a single dog will bark or growl, and the expression should be so translated.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 23:18</span> male prostitutes associated with Canaanite temples are called “dogs\", and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 22:15</span> sexual perverts or promiscuous people seem to be meant by the expression.

By this date there were already ivory trade routes from the Sudan down the Nile and by sea from where Djibouti is now on the African Red Sea coast to where Eilat is now on the Gulf of Aqaba. Some of the ivory may have been made from the teeth of the hippopotamus but two references, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:22</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:21</span>, specifically refer to elephant ivory (literally “elephant’s tooth\"). Ivory was probably known even much earlier than this since ornaments dating from around 2300 B.C. have been found in Palestine.","The Indian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em> was domesticated and trained for use in war very early well before the second millennium B.C. When Alexander the Great extended his empire into India in the fourth century B.C. he obtained war elephants to incorporate into his army. The idea of using elephants in war then spread to the Middle East. There was a smaller variety of this elephant found in Syria and Mesopotamia. By the third century B.C. domestic Indian elephants had been introduced into Egypt. Ptolemy II is reported to have had ninety-six elephants, four to a chariot, and later that same century when Ptolemy IV defeated the Seleucid king of Syria, Antiochus III, he is reported to have captured Syrians’ elephants. However, the Seleucid kings continued to use war elephants, and the next king, Epiphanes, attacked Egypt with elephants. He and his son then used them in their campaign against the Jews. According to 1Maccabees each elephant with thirty-two soldiers mounted on it, besides the Indian handler went into battle ahead of one thousand Syrian soldiers and five hundred horsemen. One of Maccabeus’ brothers was able to kill the largest elephant by getting under it and stabbing it, but he was himself killed when the elephant fell on him. At a later time probably because the Indian elephants were difficult to obtain the African Elephant <em>Loxodonta africana</em> was tamed for use in war. Coins show that the elephants used by the Roman Emperor Hadrian to cross the Alps were African probably brought from North Africa.

The elephant’s trunk is basically an elongated nose, but it has muscles that make it a very useful feature. With it the elephant can not only smell but can pull down branches to eat, pick berries off bushes, draw up water to squirt into its mouth or over its body, and can use it as a weapon. On either side of the trunk the males grow long tusks that are often over 2 meters (6 feet) in length. These are used for digging up roots, gouging bark off trees, and lifting logs. These tusks are made of ivory. Elephants have large ears, which they use to fan themselves.","They are a dark gray color and have no fur.

In the land of Israel and Egypt there are several species of hare, the most common being a subspecies of the European Brown Hare, <em>Lepus europaeus</em>, the Arabian Hare <em>Lepus arabicus</em>, and the African Hare, <em>Lepus capensis</em>. Hares and rabbits were classified as rodents until the 1950s along with mice rats and squirrels. They are now classified as “lagomorphs” since true rodents have enamel only on the front side of their long front teeth (incisors) while hares and rabbits have enamel on both sides.","Hares are found naturally in virtually every part of the world except Australasia where the European Rabbit <em>Oryctolagus cumiculus</em> was introduced. The main obvious differences between hares and rabbits are a) rabbits live in burrows they make themselves while hares do not although they may temporarily occupy holes made by other animals and b) rabbits live in family groups while hares are mainly solitary.","In the Law of Moses hares are forbidden food because “they chew the cud but do not have cloven hooves.” In fact hares do not chew cud but they certainly often look as if they are doing so. Among some species of hare there is a phenomenon called “refection” which has a result something like the chewing of cud in that it involves chewing the same food twice. Among these hares two different types of dropping are produced. One type consisting of partially digested food is eaten by the hares. Some writers have suggested that this is what is referred to by the biblical expression “chewing the cud\". However this phenomenon has not been seen among Middle Eastern hares.","The prohibition is strictly a religious or ritual one as hares are an important food in many countries.

They were first domesticated in the central Asian and Mongolian grasslands, the original home of the eastern wild horse, sometime before 2000 B.C. (The European wild horse was domesticated considerably later.) By 1700 B.C. horses had been imported into Canaan and Egypt. The fact that horses were imported made them very expensive, and for centuries horses were only owned by kings and wealthy local chiefs. Their military potential was soon recognized, and armies that were equipped with war chariots and had soldiers on horseback had an enormous advantage over those that did not. Horses gave armies a mobility they had never had before, and completely changed battle tactics.","In more recent times, horses have been carried abroad by European colonists and introduced to virtually every country on earth. The so-called “wild horses” of Spain, France, the Americas, and Australia are actually domesticated horses that have returned to their wild state.","Joseph, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 47:17</span> (the first mention of horses in the Bible), used the widespread famine and Egypt’s store of grain as an opportunity to obtain horses for the Pharaoh. He thus weakened the neighboring tribes, while giving Pharaoh’s army better military capability. It is ironic that these horses were later used against Israelites under Moses.","The Canaanites also had horses and chariots, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 17:16</span> the people of Israel were prohibited from acquiring horses, as this was seen as weakening their reliance on God. Militarily they were thus at a considerable disadvantage in their wars against the Canaanite tribes. They counteracted this disadvantage by concentrating on fighting in the hill country, or occasionally in swampy land (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 4:7; Judg 5:19; Judg 5:20; Judg 5:21</span>), where chariots were useless. They cut the hamstring tendon at the back of the hind legs on captured horses, rendering them useless to both Canaanites and themselves (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 11:9</span>). Even so, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 1:19</span> states that “Judah drove out the inhabitants of the mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys because they had iron chariots” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>; compare also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","Joshua, Saul, and David seem to have heeded the warning not to acquire horses. However, David finally gave in to the temptation, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 8:4</span> we read that although he hamstrung most of the captured horses, he kept a hundred for himself. The advantage that he gained was later turned against him when two of his sons, Absalom (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 15:1</span>) and Adonijah (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 1:5</span>), equipped themselves with horses from David’s stables in preparation for their revolts against him.","However, it was Solomon who made horses and chariots a major component of the Israelite army. He imported horses from Egypt and Cilicia at a cost of 150 shekels each, and he received horses as part of the annual tax paid to him by smaller states.

Stallions neigh and fight each other to establish which is dominant, especially when they are in the presence of mares. This is what is possibly referred to in the Jeremiah passage.","The word <em>’abir</em> literally means “mighty ones” and possibly could be a reference to exceptionally big, strong stallion war-horses, of the kind called “chargers” or “steeds” in archaic English. In many languages it will be best translated by a phrase meaning something like “fierce horse\", or with a more figurative phrase such as “warrior horse” or “chief horse\". In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 50:11</span> the fact that this is a male horse is important, since this verse refers to the uncontrollable nature of stallions, especially when in the presence of female horses and other stallions.","<em>sus</em> and <em>hippos</em> are the general words for horse in the Old and New Testaments respectively.

In these two passages there is a difference in numbers. In the Hebrew text <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> refers to 40,000 stables, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:25</span> to 4,000 stables.

It appears that this unusual translation in turn is the result of opting for the figure four thousand. If the forty thousand of the Hebrew text were accepted, there would then be forty thousand stalls for chariot horses, but only twelve thousand horses!","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> tries to avoid this pitfall with “Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.” However, this actually also equates <em>parash</em> with “chariot horse\", which it does not and cannot do in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has “Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.” This translation of <em>parash</em> is consistent, but it ignores the difference in context. The narrator would then be counting stables and horsemen in the same phrase, which is highly unlikely.","The majority of commentaries and the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr>) accept the Hebrew text (forty thousand) as the better text for this verse. This is reflected by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> ’s “Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","Since <em>parash</em> refers in different contexts to (a) war-horses and their riders, (b) only the riders, or (c) only the war-horses, this translation as cavalry horses is consistent.

The Hebrew text seems, on the surface, to give forty thousand as the number of stables, but it is possible that the writer intended to indicate the number of horses stabled there.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> footnote, “charioteers\", for <em>parash</em> has very little support.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>: The generally accepted exegesis of this verse is “Solomon had four thousand outbuildings for his chariots and horses, and had twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). This rendering accepts an inconsistency between <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>.","A solution, which is defensible, and which avoids the inconsistency, is to follow the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> “stables for forty thousand chariot horses,” and the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> rendering of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:25</span> “four thousand stalls,” since it is possible to house forty thousand horses in four thousand stables.

twice in the Bible one of them being in the phrase <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 12:9</span>). The word <em>‘ayit</em> is usually taken to mean a screamer and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 15:11</span> it is obviously a bird hence the interpretation “bird of prey” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:3.8\">3.8 Eagle vulture</a>). <em>tsavu‘a</em> is taken to mean “speckled blotched\". Thus the “speckled screamer” is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) and by others to mean “hyena” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>). However, there are also scholars who relate <em>‘ayit</em> to a different Hebrew root that means “to attack greedily” and take <em>‘ayit</em> to mean “prey” or even “carrion\". These latter scholars interpret <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> to mean “prey for hyenas” or “carrion for hyenas” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, New Revised Standard Version). It is recommended that this exegesis be followed. Another possible rendering of the phrase could even be a place of scavenging hyenas.","There is considerable doubt about the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>tsiyim</em> and different translations have marmots, wild animals, wild cats, desert animals and even sharks and dolphins. It is clear that the word refers to a specific dangerous wild animal (possibly which lives in the desert) often associated with destruction and with jackals. Although not mentioned at all in the English versions there are many scholars zoologists among them who interpret this word as referring to the hyena.","The uncertainty surrounding the word relates to the fact that nobody is sure what other Hebrew words <em>tsiyim</em> is related to. Some relate it to a word for “desert\", thus “desert creature\". This interpretation does not exclude the hyena and in fact since the references seem to be to a specific animal rather than to desert animals in general the contexts would all fit “hyena” well. The trend among scholars today is to associate it with a word that disappeared early from Hebrew meaning “to wail or yelp\". The fairly obvious conclusion from this would be that the word means “the wailer\", that is the hyena.","The translations “shark\", “dolphin” and “marmot” can be dismissed as very doubtful, especially “marmot\", which is an animal that lives in high mountain environments and has never lived in the land of Israel.","The Striped Hyena <em>Hyaena hyaena</em> has been a very well-known and common animal in the Middle East since time immemorial.

The verse would then mean something like “His enemies [those hyenas] will bow before him; his foes will lick the dust.” Others, however, taking <em>tsiyim</em> to mean “desert creatures\", understand this to be a metaphorical reference to desert tribes and interpret the text to mean “Desert tribes will bow before him; his enemies will lick the dust.” It is entirely possible that a word play was intended and that both meanings are included: “Desert tribes [those hyenas] will bow before him . . . .\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 74:14</span>: A literal translation of the Hebrew would be:","You crushed the heads of Leviathan,","And gave him as food to people, to <em>tsiyim</em>.","Most English translations render this as:","You crushed the heads of Leviathan,","And gave his carcass to desert creatures to eat.","However, very old Jewish traditions, which have this verse as their basis, tell how God will kill the monster Leviathan and then hold a feast for his people, with Abraham as the host.

In later English “rabbit” came to be used for the adults as well. “Coney” then dropped out of use except among fur traders. However it is certain that the Hebrew word <em>shafan</em> does not mean “rabbit” so the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translation “coney” was incorrect. In the nineteenth century, Bible readers perhaps not being sure what a “coney” was, came to identify the “coney” with the Syrian hyrax, probably as the result of hearing preachers describe the animal. To these readers then “coney” acquired a new meaning that it had nowhere else. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> use of “coney” is thus both archaic and incorrect.","<strong>Badger</strong>: Two types of badger live in the land of Israel. The more common is <em>Meles meles</em> and the second is the ratel or Honey Badger <em>Mellivora capensis</em>. The ratel eats anything from small mammals to lizards, insects, snails, fruit, honey and any dead animal or bird. But the animal referred to in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:5</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 14:7</span> eats only vegetation and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 104:18</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 30:26</span> it is associated with rocks as its natural habitat. <em>Shafan</em> therefore cannot be the badger or the ratel. Thus those versions using “badger” are likewise incorrect.","<strong>Rock badger</strong>: Mystery surrounds the name “rock badger\". There was no known animal popularly called a “rock badger” prior to the release of the Brown, Driver, and Briggs translation of Gesenius’ Hebrew Lexicon in 1906. In this lexicon apparently for the first time, “rock badger” appears as the translation of the Hebrew <em>shafan</em>. It is unclear why they coined this new word in preference to the more common “rock rabbit\", but it was probably the result of translating the Cape Dutch <em>klip dassie</em> (\"little rock badger\") too literally. However “rock badger” has been used by most English translators ever since. Both “coney” and “rock badger” are, however, not only basically meaningless to most readers but are also incorrect.","The animal referred to by the Hebrew word <em>shafan</em> is undoubtedly the Syrian Rock Hyrax <em>Procavia capensis syriaca</em>. This identification was first made by Canon Tristram in 1867 and has been confirmed many times since. It is a very common animal in the Middle East and Africa eats only vegetation and lives among the rocks.","In southern and eastern Africa other subspecies of the Hyrax <em>Procavia capensis</em> and the Yellow-spotted Hyrax <em>Heterohyrax brucei</em> are sometimes called “rock rabbit\", but are more usually called by the Afrikaans name “dassie\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Hyraxes are found only in the Middle East and Africa.

They look a bit like giant guinea pigs or cane rats, but they are not really rodents. They live mainly on leaves and herbs. The structure of their jaws, teeth, and feet and the size of their prehistoric ancestors link them to the rhinoceros and elephant.","Two of their top front teeth develop into small tusks which sometimes protrude from the side of their mouth. They have four toes on their front feet and three on the back feet. These toes do not have claws but each has a small hoof-like nail. The soles of their feet are perpetually clammy, being lubricated by a special gland. This enables them to run up almost vertical rock faces and climb trees with ease. In the middle of their back they have another large gland covered with an oval patch of hairs of a different color. These hairs can be raised as an alarm signal.","For such small mammals hyraxes have a very long gestation period of seven months. They live in fairly large family groups and since they are unable to regulate their body temperature by perspiring they huddle together in cavities under rocks when the weather is cold and lie stretched out in breezy locations in the shade of the rocks or trees when it is hot. They are thus only active and visible when the temperature is neither very hot nor cold.","They are quite vocal creatures, communicating by a variety of grunts, whistle-like alarm squeals, and territory-marking barks.","The Syrian rock hyrax is a fawny gray color with a yellowish back patch.

These are members of the same animal family which includes the wolf and the dog. The word “jackal” was borrowed from the Arabic <em>jakal</em> which is from the same Semitic root as the Hebrew word <em>shu‘al</em>. In the days of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> the word “jackal” had not yet been introduced into the English language and so in that version “fox” is used throughout for <em>shu‘al</em>.","Modern scholars are almost unanimous in agreeing that the word <em>’iyim</em> (plural of <em>’iy</em>) is derived from a root meaning “to howl” and that it refers to howling jackals in particular.

The red fox is a smallish animal, about 1 meter (3 feet) from nose to tip of the tail. It is usually reddish with white underparts and a bushy tail. Red foxes feed mainly on mice and rats but also eat chickens, game birds, and fallen fruit. They may occasionally eat carrion (dead animals), but are not scavengers in the usual sense of the word.","The Desert Fox <em>Vulpes ruppelli</em> and the Egyptian Fox <em>Vulpes nilotica</em> are slightly smaller and yellowish brown, but they are otherwise very similar to the red fox. The Fennec <em>Vulpes zerda</em> is a very small fox with large ears. It is now found in the Middle East and Egypt and was probably found in Israel also in earlier times. It feeds on insects and mice.","Foxes live in pairs, singly or in small family groups when they have young. During the day they live in holes in the ground usually dug by some other animal and come out at night to feed. When chased by dogs they are very clever at escaping, often doubling back on their tracks and then jumping sideways and heading in a new direction, thus confusing the scent trail. They also run up streams and thus avoid laying a scent trail altogether.","<strong>Jackal</strong>: The jackal found in Israel is the Golden or Oriental Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>. It is also sometimes referred to as the Indian jackal. This animal is larger than the fox. It is yellowish brown with black tips to the long fur on its back.","Jackals eat almost anything and are great opportunists moving very fast with clever tactics when they have to. They have been known to steal bread from people’s houses and baby animals even from dangerous wild pigs. They are scavengers, eating household rubbish as well as carrion, especially the remains of carcasses killed by lions, but they also eat beetles and birds’ eggs and kill small mammals game birds and domestic chickens and ducks.","In some of the literature there is reference to the fact that jackals live in packs. This is not strictly correct. They live in pairs or small family groups but they may associate temporarily in larger groups when many pairs are attracted to the same burrows, carrion, refuse dumps, or potential prey. In these larger temporary groups they may cooperate and act together like a pack.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0541_jackal\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0541_jackal.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0541_jackal\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Jackal — A jackal guards its meal</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2012-bb-jackal-1.jpg • © Yathin S Krishnappa, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0541_jackal.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Jackals live in burrows made by other animals or in abandoned human houses or shelters and emerge to feed at night.

To say that a certain place would become the dwelling place of jackals meant that the place would become deserted and lie in ruins, as the result of war. The jackal was thus a symbol of death and desolation as well as insignificance and opportunistic craftiness."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In areas where jackals are known, but not foxes, the word for jackal can be used for both.

If the former is in focus, Jesus is inferring that even though Herod Antipas is a crafty opportunist, his plans are known. If the latter sense is intended, as seems more likely, then Jesus is inferring that Herod does not have the power to stop him doing what he has to do. Some commentators have argued that both inferences are intended since both the Greek and Hebrew metaphors would have been known.","If the Greek inference is decided upon, then the word <em>alōpēx</em> could be translated “crafty fox” or “crafty jackal\".

They are found throughout tropical mainland Asia and Africa. They are about 2 meters (6 feet) in length and are a yellowish brown color with black spots arranged in rosettes all over the body and tail. These spots make it very easy for a leopard to blend in with patches of shade and sunlight in or under bushes and trees. They are extremely agile, and this agility and their natural camouflage are used to the full in their hunting methods. They stalk gazelles, antelope, or deer (occasionally goats or sheep) until they are within ten or fifteen meters (30-50 feet) or less. They then break cover and leap onto their prey. They have a slightly different strategy when hunting monkeys and baboons. They drive them to the extreme ends of branches by climbing after them, and when the monkey or baboon finally drops from the tree, the leopard leaps after it and catches it on the ground.","Once a leopard has killed an animal, it carries it into a tree or onto a high rock to eat, possibly to get away from hyenas. Once a leopard has satisfied its appetite, if there is still meat left on the carcass, it will leave the carcass in the fork of a branch and return to feed again later. The exception to this is when a female has cubs. She will then carry the kill to her cubs in a lair under rocks or a log, but she will still carry any leftover meat into a tree to store in the branches. Unlike lions and cheetahs, leopards do not chase their prey over long distances.","Leopards live and hunt alone, coming together only at mating time. Cubs stay with their mothers only until they can hunt on their own; they are usually completely on their own by the time they are one year old. A female leopard with cubs is very protective and extremely dangerous.","Occasionally a leopard will be born completely black (the so-called black panther).

This is due in large part to the fact that the English translators and the commentators who have guided them have had many mistaken ideas about lions and their behavior. To take <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> as an example, Smalley and de Waard, commenting on this verse and echoing Hughell Fosbroke and many others, claim: “The lion’s roar in the first picture is the ferocious roar with which the lion attacks an animal he is going to kill and eat. When someone hears this roar, he knows that the lion has found his victim. In the second picture, however, it is the lion’s contented growl when he has dragged the food to his den.\"","However, lions do not roar as they attack their prey, (in fact they kill very silently as a rule), and lions do not normally live in dens. Moreover, they do not growl contentedly when eating. Instead they growl and snarl at the other lions in the pride who are trying to share the meal.","In case there are readers who react by thinking that it is unlikely that unsophisticated ancient peoples would have known these details, it should be pointed out that unsophisticated people all over Africa, who live in areas where there are lions, are very familiar with lion behavior, and it is highly likely that the Jewish writers were too. The problem would seem to lie with the mistaken presuppositions of western biblical scholars, rather than those of the Jewish writers. Later in this section evidence will be given that the biblical writers were very familiar with lion behavior.","In a similar vein, it is likely that the many Hebrew words for lions each have a slightly different meaning from one another. A closer study of lions and their behavior may help to define these meanings.","In biblical times lions were found all over the Middle East, in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, and in the area of Sudan and Ethiopia called Cush.","The Greek word <em>leōn</em> and the Latin <em>leo</em> are general words for lion, while the Greek <em>leontēdon</em> means something like “fierce lion\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In order to dispel many of the wrong presuppositions about lions that are current among biblical scholars, the description of this animal will be more detailed and extensive than for other animals in this book.","Lions <em>Panthera leo</em> are the largest of the great cats, often being about 2.8 meters (9 feet) from nose to tip of tail, standing as high as 1 meter (3 feet 3 inches) at the shoulder. However, the difference in size between lions and Bengal Tigers <em>Panthera tigris</em> is minimal. An adult lion is at least half a meter (20 inches) longer than a Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and weighs twice as much, often reaching 250 kilograms (550 pounds) in weight; it is about 30 centimeters (1 foot) longer and 100 kilograms (220 pounds) heavier than a Jaguar <em>Panthera onca</em> or Mountain Lion (Puma) <em>Puma concolor</em>. Lions are a pale yellowish brown, but at birth they have spots that usually disappear gradually as they grow. Around the neck and shoulders of adult males grows a mane that is darker than the rest of their fur. Some even have black manes. Females and young males do not have manes and look very similar to each other.","<strong>Social behavior</strong>: Lions live in family groups called “prides\", which are made up of a dominant male lion (often called “the pride male\"), plus a group of adult and sub adult females and young males. Males may leave the pride, and occasionally one or two females may go off with a wandering male, but normally the females continue in the pride and develop very close bonds with one another that last a lifetime. The dominant male will often make ritual attacks on the younger males of the pride, who roll over in submission rather than fight.","However, adult males from within and outside the pride challenge the dominant male and one another when a female is in season and will try to mate with her. This results in serious fights. If the dominant male is defeated from within the pride, he leaves the pride to wander alone, but the remainder of the pride remains intact. If a male from outside the pride takes over from the pride male, he usually chases away the other males, which then wander singly or in small groups of three or four. These wandering males will try to take over other prides or steal females from them. Ousted pride males, since they are alone and have no help in hunting, are often hungry, thin, undernourished, and dangerous.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0595_lioness_cub\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0595_lioness_cub.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0595_lioness_cub\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Lion — Lioness and juvenile cub</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-1686104/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0595_lioness_cub.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>About two or three days before a pregnant female is about to give birth to cubs, she digs a temporary den under a rock or fallen log and visits it with one or two of the other females. After she gives birth in the den, one of the other females will bring her meat from a kill. This enables the mother to remain with her newborn cubs continuously for the first week or two of their lives. The mother lioness moves the newborn cubs to a new den every three or four days. When the cubs are about two weeks old, the mother carries the cubs to where the other pride members are, and the pride makes their acquaintance by licking them. Thereafter the cubs belong to the pride and suckle on any lactating lioness that happens to be near.","Until they are old enough to hunt, cubs hide in thickets while the pride hunters do their work. At a later stage they accompany the hunting lions, but watch the killing from the sidelines. Finally the mother will help them kill small animals, until they are able to kill efficiently. Then they join the pride hunts.","A pride lives together in the same territory. Bushes and tree trunks are marked by spraying a liquid from a gland next to the anus. This marked territory is defended against intruding lions. The pride will come together at feeding time and remain together after a feed, but will scatter across the territory prior to hunting.","<strong>Vocal behavior</strong>: Lions utter a variety of sounds, and this should be borne in mind when translating Scripture passages that refer to the noises lions make. The Hebrew words are usually not very specific, but the context will indicate the type of noise intended.","Roaring is the loudest of the lion sounds and is usually produced by the males. It is believed to be territory-marking behavior and a means of maintaining pride solidarity. It is usually done before hunting begins and also functions to help the pride locate the positions of scattered members. This is important for hunting. Roaring consists of a long, very loud moaning sound followed by shorter rhythmic panting moans, which are repeated as many as twenty times, while becoming softer and softer. No two lions roar in exactly the same way, and they can be identified from their roars. Roaring is also a means by which wandering male lions make known their availability as potential mates. Hungry lions roar more frequently than well-fed ones, and this is an indication of how hungry they are.","Growling is a warning sound. It is a very deep rumbling repeated with each breath. It is intended to chase away strange lions or other potential enemies, such as leopards, hyenas, or humans. When a lion or lioness growls, it usually advances towards its enemy. If growling does not have the desired effect, it is replaced with snarling, which is similar to growling but is more intense and is produced with exposed teeth, the body in a low crouch, and ears laid back flat. This behavior is usually the prelude to an attack. When the attack is actually made on an enemy, a deep trembling moan is uttered, and the ensuing fight takes place with a lot of loud snarling and growling.","When lions are feeding together on one carcass, there is usually a lot of growling, snarling, and snapping among the feeding lions.","Other types of sound made by lions are:","woofing sounds when pride members meet after two or three days’ absence from each other. This sound is also used to call cubs from their hiding places;","- drawn out yawning moans by females in heat and by both lions and lionesses when mating;","- grunting sounds when chasing prey toward other lions waiting in ambush;","- contented loud purring, much as cats do.","<strong>Hunting and feeding behavior</strong>: After lions have fed well, they rest and relax together for two or three days. Towards the end of this time some of the pride members will begin to move away from the others in the direction of places where prey animals are likely to be grazing. Then, before they begin to hunt, they signal their locations by roaring on and off for an hour or two. They then fall silent and begin to hunt in earnest. Hunting usually takes one of two forms. If there is good cover near the prey, two or three lionesses and young males will stalk the prey using the cover. When they get close enough, one or two will break cover and charge at the prey, while the others maneuver to cut off any escape.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0593_lion\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0593_lion.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0593_lion\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Lion — Adult male lion</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-2400962/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0593_lion.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>If the terrain is more open, the lionesses and young males will take up ambush positions downwind of the prey animals. Adult males then move fairly openly into upwind positions. They then run toward the prey uttering loud grunts with each breath. With either method, at the first charge the lions try to disable the animal by seizing a leg or by biting the spine. Once they have slowed down the prey, one lion will seize the animal by the throat and suffocate it. Thus death is usually fairly slow and drawn out. If the animal is large, the kill takes a considerable amount of energy, and the lions rest, usually standing, before they begin to feed.","Single wandering male lions are at a great disadvantage in hunting and often go hungry. They thus roar more frequently than pride lions. They often begin to kill domestic animals and sometimes humans.","Among the lions present at the time of the kill, there is a type of seniority, with age being important. The most senior lion or lioness present will begin to feed, and this will be a signal for the others to join in. If the kill is large, they feed in relative silence, but if the prey is small, there is a lot of snarling, growling, and snapping. Whenever a dominant pride male arrives, however, the feeding lions withdraw and leave him to feed alone. A dominant male will sometimes allow an immature cub to feed with him but no mature lions. The pride members will only resume feeding when the dominant male is satisfied. Dominant males are very seldom involved in the chase or the kill. At most they make the charge that drives the prey towards lionesses and young males in ambush."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In the Bible the lion is a symbol of danger and destruction, often being paired with the bear. The lion is also a symbol of great political power and regal majesty."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Before discussing specific passages in detail, it is useful first to try and identify the various Hebrew words with likely lion types.","If we examine the verbs and adjectives with which the Hebrew nouns co-occur, we find the following:","<em>’Ari</em>: This, the most frequently used word for lion, is associated with a very wide range of verbs in the Bible, including crouching in ambush, leaping, growling, roaring, killing, destroying, tearing prey to pieces, breaking bones, attacking, breaking from cover, scattering sheep, trampling, and standing on prey. The adjectives used with this noun include strong, destructive, brave, and hungry.","From this evidence we can see that <em>’ari</em> or its feminine form <em>’aryeh</em> is the general word for lion or lioness.","<em>’Aryeh</em>: Although this is a feminine form, in English versions it is invariably translated as “lion\", because this form usually occurs in the Hebrew phrase <em>gur ’aryeh</em>, which is literally “a cub of lioness\", but which is more naturally translated as “lion cub” in English.","<em>Beney shachats</em>: This expression, which literally means “sons of pride\", occurs only once, in a poetic passage (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 28:8</span>) as the parallel of “lion” (<em>shachal</em>). Probably, besides having similar sounds, the two expressions both refer to lions. Only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> reflects this in the translation.","<em>Kefir</em>: The verbs associated with this noun include kill, prowl, hunt, snarl, attack, break cover, tear prey to pieces, roar, and growl. The only adjective associated with the noun is “angry\". Translators often render this as “young lion\". <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 19:1–Ezek 19:9</span> seems to support an identification of <em>kefir</em> with a young male lion that is an efficient killer (see the discussion of this passage below).","<em>Laviy’</em>: The verbs associated with this noun are growling, devouring, lying down, crouching, and raising cubs. The only descriptive phrase that co-occurs is big teeth. The usual <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> rendering of this word as “lioness” seems well founded.","<em>Layish</em>: This noun occurs only three times. The verb phrase that co-occurs is “ dying from lack of prey\". The adjectives that co-occur are “stately in its walk\", and “strong\". The evidence would fit an interpretation such as “lion in its prime time” or “mighty lion\". The reference would seem to be to a dominant male lion or “pride male\". Versions that render this word as “old lion” in some contexts (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), seem to be slightly misleading.","<em>Shachal</em>: The verbs that co-occur are roaring, hunting, and tearing prey to pieces. Some scholars, using evidence from Assyrian and classical Arabic, believe that this Hebrew word is derived from an older Semitic root meaning “to roar” or “to produce a call\". All available evidence would seem to allow for the interpretation of <em>shachal</em> as “male lion\". It may possibly be a word for a wandering male lion rather than a male that is a member of a pride.","In some English versions of Maccabees the Greek word <em>skumnos</em> is incorrectly translated as “cub” or “whelp\". The context refers to this creature roaring, which lion cubs do not do. The word seems rather to refer to a virile young adult lion. It is better translated as lion in its prime compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> “like a ferocious lion.\"","In areas where lions are completely unknown, it is better to borrow a word from a dominant language or from Hebrew or Greek, rather than to try and find a local equivalent. This is because the biblical references to the behavior of lions are fairly specific, and if a word for a local animal is used, it will not fit the behavior mentioned in the text. This is especially so because the lion is the only great cat (apart from the cheetah) that lives and hunts in large family groups.","Some attempt should be made to maintain the slight differences in meaning of the various Hebrew words for lions, when the context requires this. This can often be done by using short, natural-sounding descriptive phrases. Often, however, in contexts where only one of the Hebrew words for lion is used, there is no need to maintain a difference, and a simple word for lion or lioness will suffice.","The most common Hebrew phrases used for the sounds lions make are <em>sha’ag</em>, <em>(natan) qol</em>, <em>naham</em>. When <em>sha’ag</em> is used in contexts of human vocal behavior, it indicates cries of pain or distress. In contexts of animal vocal behavior, however, it can signal pain and distress but can also be an aggressive sound and can be translated “bellow, roar, moan, snarl, growl” or sometimes “bark\". A similar Arabic word usually refers to the lowing of cattle or the bleating of goats. For lions English translators have consistently chosen “roar\", because of their mistaken preconception that a lion’s “roar” is an aggressive sound. In most contexts it is best interpreted as “growl” or “snarl\".","(<em>Natan</em>) <em>qol</em>, on the other hand, is a more general expression and can mean any sort of vocalization, from calling, to groaning or singing. English translators of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> have chosen “growl” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) and “cry out” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). In this text this word is the parallel of <em>sha’ag</em>, so the reason for these interpretations is plain. However, a neutral translation, such as “make a sound\", would be equally valid. Of all the Hebrew expressions for lion sounds, this is the one most likely to mean roar, especially in contexts where the noun <em>shachal</em> occurs for “lion\", as for example in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 4:10</span>.","<em>Naham</em> means to moan in sorrow or pain when used of humans and is usually translated as to growl when used of animals.","<strong>Lion habitats and the meaning of <em>ma‘on</em> in the context of lions</strong>: Generally the word <em>ma‘on</em> means dwelling place, hiding place, or refuge. In one or two places it refers to a military refuge or fortress. When used of animals, it can mean “lair” (as for jackals), “hiding place\", “territory\", or simply “place where the animals are found\". The choice in translating this Hebrew word has been either “lair” or “den” in all English translations. This choice again seems to be related to the misconceptions about the behavior of lions. Lions do not usually live in dens or lairs, and it is better to translate <em>ma‘on</em> as “territory” or “place where lions live\". See the discussion below for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:8; Gen 49:10</span>: The major problems in interpreting this passage relate to the meaning of the verb <em>‘alah</em>. TEV, REB, and NIV interpret <span class=\"scripture-ref\">‘alah</span> in verse 9 as “return” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> even has “return to his den\"). However, the more usual meaning of the Hebrew verb is “to rise up\", and in this context this makes perfect sense. As mentioned above, when a lion has killed its prey, the lion usually stands up, panting, and rests in this position for some minutes before crouching down again to start feeding.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 4:10; Job 4:11</span>: In this passage there is clearly a logical link between the fact that the teeth of the efficient killers (<em>kefirim</em>) are broken and the fact that the dominant male (<em>layish</em>) is dying because no kills have been made. Most English translations translate <em>taref</em> as “prey\", which infers that the problem is a lack of animals to hunt. It would be better to translate this word as “kills\", that is, animals that have been killed.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 22:13</span>: The Hebrew of this passage indicates clearly that the growling or snarling and the tearing at prey are directed at the writer.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:38; Jer 51:39</span>: The English translations that take <em>kefir</em> to mean “young lions” misrepresent slightly the picture portrayed in this verse. Rather than being the immature roar of young lions, the text refers to the frightening roar of hungry hunting lions.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 19:1; Ezek 19:9</span>: In this passage the picture of a lioness training her cubs to become efficient killers is clearly presented. This gives us a good indication of the meaning of <em>kefir</em>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 11:10</span>: The picture here is of a lion roaring and the other members of the pride coming in response. The picture given in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> of God roaring at his enemies is not justified.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span>: A choice has to be made about the type of vocalizing the lion is doing, and why. If, as the existing text seems to require, the presupposition is that the lion has caught its prey, then the translation of <em>sha’ag</em> and <em>natan qol</em> will involve appropriate choices. “Snarl” and “growl” seem to be legitimate. These fit the context, match real lion behavior, and are still valid translations of the Hebrew roots.","Next, it is necessary to make a suitable choice for <em>ma‘on</em>. “The place where it hides” would be quite appropriate, paralleling “bush” in the first line of the couplet.","The two words for lion in this verse are <em>’aryeh</em> and <em>kefir</em>. The first should be rendered “lioness” and the second “lion” or “killer lion\".","<em>A Translator’s Handbook on the Book of Amos</em> can thus be rephrased: “The snarling in the first line and the growling in the second both refer to the warning sounds lions make when feeding together.\"","Figure 13 in the Amos Handbook gives an analysis in which the relationship of this verse to the argument is seen as being the theme “Disaster\", presumably that which has befallen the prey. However, if the lion is consistently seen as the symbol of God, then one would expect <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> to be seen as inferring that God is “roaring” (to use the Handbook’s interpretation) because a disaster has already befallen the nation of Israel, just as a “lion roars because it has caught its prey\". Yet in the corresponding element of the chiasmus, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a, the analysis in the Handbook identifies the disaster as being in the future, since the “roar” is interpreted as a warning. The analysis is thus not cohesive at these points.","If, however, the growling and snarling (rather than roaring) refer to the aggressive behavior of feeding lions toward each other and toward other predators and scavengers, their behavior would be more closely related to warning than to destroying. This shows better cohesion between <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a. If <em>sha’ag</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a is also translated “snarl\", the warning effect is greatly heightened.","The labels on the Handbook’s chiastic structure would now be:","A Harmony","B Warning signs","C Disaster","D Confusion","C' Disaster","B' Warning signs","A' Harmony","Interestingly enough this alternate translation does not change the basic arguments as identified by the Handbook, but strengthens them.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 2:11; Mic 2:12</span>: The major problems of interpretation in this verse, have been the word <em>kefir</em>, usually translated here as “cubs\", and the words <em>ma‘on</em>, <em>mir‘eh</em>, and <em>chor</em>, usually translated as “den\", “lair\", and “cave\".","In RSV, NEB, and REB, the presupposition is that lions live in dens, to which they carry their prey, and that the male lion in the passage tears up a carcass to feed to the lionesses and cubs. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> shares this presupposition but adds the idea that lion cubs are fed in the den. But, as we have seen, lions do not live in dens, and male lions do not tear up carcasses to feed cubs. And they certainly do not feed lionesses; they usually compete with them for the meat.","A better interpretation is to take <em>kefir</em> in the same way as in the previous passages, that is, as killer lion. <em>Ma‘on</em> seems to mean “dwelling place, territory” in this context. <em>Mir‘eh</em> is interpreted in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> as “feeding place\", which fits the context well. This leaves <em>chor</em>, which functions here as a parallel expression to <em>me‘onot</em> “territories\". <em>Chor</em> normally means “hole” or “cave” and can be taken to refer to the temporary dens where suckling lionesses are fed by other lionesses."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲרִי, אַרְיֵה","transliteration":"’ari, ’aryeh","references":["Gen 49:9","Gen 49:9","Num

and it is very difficult to know what it refers to. In the Masoretic Text it is written as two words <em>lachpor perot</em> which seem to mean “to dig holes\". But the ancient versions interpret the two words of the Masoretic Text to be a single word <em>lachafarparot</em> a noun phrase literally meaning to “the dig-diggers” or “to the search-searchers” so it is taken by them to mean “to the moles\".

The domesticated pig was known in Egypt around 2500 B.C. and was probably domesticated in Canaan about that time too. Domestication of wild pigs seems to have coincided everywhere with the development of agriculture. Wild pigs were probably penned in large enclosures and fed scraps, thus keeping them away from planted fields. Later on, when full domestication had taken place, it was more usual for pigs to be herded rather than kept in pens. Pigs eat almost anything and herding did away with the necessity to feed them. It soon was noticed that the rooting activity of the pigs rid areas of tree roots and shrubs and promoted the growth of grass for grazing. So early swineherds herded the pigs into areas where future grazing was wanted, away from planted fields. Jews who kept pigs may not have done so with the idea of eating their meat, which was unclean, but to promote grazing grass and to sell the pigs to neighboring tribes.","Wild pigs, in the form of the European Boar <em>Sus scrofus</em>, were once abundant in Israel, especially in the Jordan Valley. Even now since neither Jews nor Moslems eat the meat of wild pigs, and thus do not hunt them, they can still be found in the Jordan Valley and in many other areas where there is both water and thick undergrowth.","The Greek words <em>choiros</em> and <em>hueios</em> mean “pig” or “pig meat\".

of Abraham at least five breeds of sheep had already been developed in Mesopotamia. From mummified remains (that is, preserved dead bodies) and ancient art it is also known that at least two different breeds had reached Egypt by about 2000 B.C. Thus it is likely that the sheep mentioned in the Bible were of more than one breed.","The Hebrew word <em>kar</em> seems to be used of imported foreign sheep and may refer to a special breed but some scholars think it refers to a wether (castrated ram), since this word is never used in the context of sacrifice. This word is also used for a battering ram, that is, a heavy pole suspended on a rope, used in war for breaking down walls. <em>’Ayil</em> is the word for a ram or adult male sheep, <em>rachel</em> is a breeding ewe or female sheep, and <em>taleh</em> is a very young lamb, probably still unweaned. The remaining Hebrew words refer to sheep in general.","The Greek word <em>probaton</em> is the general word for sheep, or flocks that may include goats. <em>Krios</em> is the Greek word for a ram or male sheep. <em>Pascha</em> is a technical name for the Passover lamb exclusively, and the remaining Greek words all mean lamb. <em>Ovis</em> is the Latin word for sheep.","The early Hebrews were nomadic shepherds to whom sheep were the most important domestic animal. While goats eat almost any vegetation, sheep are much more selective about the grasses and plants they eat. This meant that suitable grazing for them was not always easy to find, and shepherds had to keep moving their flocks from place to place. This led to a nomadic lifestyle, with movable tents rather than houses being the normal household shelter. It was not until the occupation of Canaan after the Exodus that the lifestyle of the Israelites changed, and they became settled village-dwelling farmers and fruit growers.","However, even then, most households owned sheep, and some family members would function as shepherds, often living away from home for fairly long periods.","Sheep in the Bible were a source of meat, milk, wool, hides, and horns, and it seems likely that various strains were bred selectively to enhance production of these commodities. Wool is mentioned in the Bible as early as the Mosaic Law, which forbade the weaving of cloth containing both wool and plant fibers. The shearing of sheep is mentioned even earlier, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 31:19</span>. Wool was in fact the most common and available fiber known to the people of Israel.","There was a very extensive wool trade in biblical times, stretching from Egypt to China. In the Middle East wool was cheaper than cotton or linen, which were the other common fibers. (Silk was known by the time of Solomon, but it was extremely expensive as it was produced in China and handled by numerous traders on its way west.) It would be a mistake to think of all wool at that time as being white, as <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 30:0</span> indicates quite clearly that there were also dark colored sheep and sheep that had dark and light patches, probably varying combinations of black, white, and brown.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Sheep — A ewe with her lamb</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">© Ray Pritz by United Bible Societies</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/PRITZ/PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>We can be fairly sure that one breed of sheep known to the Israelites was the Fat-tailed Sheep <em>Ovis laticaudata</em> and that its fatty tail is referred to in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:22; Lev 3:9; Lev 8:25; Lev 9:19</span>.","Rams’ horns had a variety of uses. Whole ram horns were used as drinking vessels, jars, and trumpets. But pieces of horn were used as handles for knives and other household implements, and for jewelry such as bracelets and beads. Needles too, and probably also arrow heads, were made from horn, as well as from bone and later from bronze and iron.","Sheep were also very important in Israelite religion.

They differ in that sheep produce wool, which is a special type of soft hair, among the ordinary hairs on their bodies. A ram’s horns too differ in shape from a goat’s horns, those of a ram curling down in a tight spiral beside its face, with those of a goat curving more gently back towards its shoulders. The sheep of biblical times produced much shorter wool than is common with wool-bearing breeds of today.","The fat-tailed or broad-tailed sheep is a smallish breed usually brown and white with a very broad tail. Like most other breeds of sheep in the Middle East it has large floppy ears.","Sheep are generally fairly timid animals, lacking the self-confidence and adaptability of goats. While goats will spread out in their search for food and then regroup without much difficulty, sheep become very insecure when they are separated from other sheep and tend to stay bunched together. They thus require a lot of shepherding. In the Middle East the method of shepherding involves training the dominant ram to follow the shepherd. The remaining sheep then follow this dominant ram, which often wears a wooden clapper or a bell. As they feed, the sheep usually keep within earshot of this sound. It is likely that this method is centuries old.

Like sheep the people are seen as easily going astray (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 119:176; Isa 53:6; Jer 50:6; 1 Pet 2:25</span>), as being in need of guidance and protection (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 22:17; 2 Chr 18:16; Matt 9:36; Mark 6:34</span>), as being very defenseless (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 52:7</span>), and as being destined to an early death (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 44:22; Jer 12:3; Rom 8:36</span>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0092_lamb\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0092_lamb.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0092_lamb\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Lamb</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">© Ray Pritz by United Bible Societies</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/PRITZ/PTZ-0092_lamb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>The metaphor of a lamb is used in the New Testament to refer to Christ, with an emphasis on his being a sacrifice for the sin of the world. This is especially the case in John’s gospel and Revelation. In the latter book the metaphor is introduced in a very striking way. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 5:5</span> as the writer is mourning the fact that no one can be found to open the scroll, he is comforted by one of the elders who tells him that “the Lion of the tribe of Judah” has triumphed and can thus open the scroll. Then the writer, expecting to see the Lion, sees instead a Lamb that looks as if it has been killed for sacrifice. The remainder of the book is then concerned with describing the triumph of this Lamb over the forces of evil.","In the gospels Jesus also refers to his disciples as “sheep” and “lambs” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:17; John 10:1; John 21:15; John 21:17; John 21:18</span>).","The metaphor of the shepherd is extended to God himself who is the ultimate “Shepherd of Israel” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 23:1; Ps 80:1</span>). Then those who are responsible for the nurture, guidance, ruling, and protection of Israel, be it kings, prophets, or priests, are also likened to shepherds (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 56:11; Jer 23:4; Jer 49:19; Ezek 34:2; Zech 10:2</span>).","The Messiah is also called a shepherd (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:11</span>), and Jesus refers to himself as “the good shepherd” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 10:11</span>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 13:20</span> he is referred to as “the great shepherd of the sheep” and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Pet 2:25</span> he is called “the Shepherd and Guardian of your lives\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In languages that have a word for sheep, it is advisable to translate according to the meanings given under Discussion above. If possible, the feminine forms should be translated as “female lamb” or “female sheep\". In languages in which sheep are not known, a word has usually been coined or borrowed by the time Bible translation begins, and this word should be used. It is not advisable to substitute another locally well-known animal in this case, since doing so negates the ritual and symbolic importance that sheep had for the biblical cultures.","In translating <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 23:1</span> it is extremely important to make sure that the phrase “my shepherd” preserves the relationship intended by the writer and reflects the psalmist’s theme that Yahweh is his benefactor, protector, and guide. There are really two metaphors involved in the opening verse-the caring shepherd (God) and by clear implication, the dependent sheep (the psalmist). In many languages the literal phrase “my shepherd” depicts a wrong relationship, meaning something like “the one who looks after my sheep” or “the one I employ to watch my sheep.” In many African languages unwary translators have produced a rendering that means “The Chief is (nothing more than) my herdsman.” It is often necessary to restructure the whole verse as something like “I am a sheep, and the lord is my shepherd.\""]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיִל","transliteration":"’ayil","references":["Gen 15:9","Gen 22:13","Gen 22:13","Gen 31:38","Gen 32:15","Exod

basic domestic animals. A poor person may not have owned any cattle or goats but would generally have had sheep. In Nathan’s parable in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 12:3–2 Sam 12:6</span> the poverty of the one person is emphasized by the fact that he had only one lamb.","A wealthy person, on the other hand might own so many animals of different kinds that the herd would be divided up into flocks, each of which had its own herding personnel. In the search for grazing and water, the different flocks, all belonging to one person, would be scattered in different areas. In biblical Hebrew a combination of flocks of domestic animals can be referred to by the inclusive word <em>‘eder</em>. This word usually includes sheep, but it can also include goats, cattle, donkeys, and possibly even camels. Within a person’s <em>‘eder</em> sheep would have been the most numerous. If a writer wanted to be more specific, the groups of domestic animals within the <em>‘eder</em> could be referred to with words meaning flocks, cattle, donkeys, and camels.","This “flock” within an <em>‘eder</em> was called in Hebrew <em>ts’on</em>. This word always included sheep but could include goats too. Within the <em>ts’on</em> sheep would outnumber goats.","A <em>ts’on</em> consisted of individual animals called <em>seh</em>. While this word usually denotes sheep it can refer to goats too. In some contexts some English versions translate this word as “animal\". For instance in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 12:5</span> the Hebrew text is best translated as “It must be an animal (<em>seh</em>) without defect, a one year old male; you may choose it either from your sheep or from your goats.\""]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The text itself will often indicate the kinds of animal being referred to. In these contexts the translation is not usually difficult. However, when <em>‘eder</em> is used without indication of what animals are intended, in many languages it is best to translate this word by a phrase meaning “herds of domestic animals” or “herds of animals which people raise\".","Similarly with <em>ts’on</em>, the context often indicates whether sheep or goats are being referred to. However, where this word occurs without further clarification, it is best translated as “flocks of sheep and goats\".","The translation of <em>seh</em> is not quite so straightforward. In some contexts it is best rendered “one animal\", in others “one sheep or goat\", and in others “a sheep\". In languages in which there are different noun classes or classifiers for large and small animals, the appropriate one for an animal the size of a sheep or goat should be used when translating <em>seh</em> as “animal\"."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מַרְעִית","transliteration":"mar‘it","references":["Jer

However, there are problems connected with this rendering. The usual justifications for this translation are a) that the Akkadian equivalent word <em>rimu</em> refers to the wild ox or Aurochs <em>Bos primigenius</em>, which was frequently hunted by Akkadian kings and b) that wild ox or aurochs fits the description of the wild untameable animal referred to in the Bible.","Both of these arguments have weaknesses from a zoological point of view and the linguistic argument is also debatable. Firstly, the aurochs hunted by the Akkadian kings was an animal found in high rainfall areas with forests. In historical times it was found only in the wooded areas of central and southeastern Europe Armenia (including the southern coastland of the Black Sea) and Mesopotamia. The only aurochs remains found in the land of Israel and the Arabian Peninsula date from the early Pleistocene Age. It is highly unlikely that this animal lived in Israel in biblical times.","Secondly, while the Akkadian <em>rimu</em> is usually translated as “wild ox\", the Ugaritic <em>rum</em> has been translated by some scholars as “buffalo\", and the Old Arabic <em>rim</em> is usually translated as “oryx\". Both of these words are related to the Hebrew <em>re’em</em>. Some scholars have argued that the <em>re’em</em> is really the oryx.","Furthermore, while the wild aurochs was very large, dangerous, and strong, it was not really “untameable\". Its dependence on water made it fairly easy to capture in nets and it was domesticated very early. It is the ancestor of all short-horned European cattle. Ancient pictures carved in limestone found in the excavations at Kujunjik in Iraq show carts being pulled by cattle that look exactly the same as the aurochs pictured in hunting scenes from an earlier period.","An animal similar to the aurochs was hunted by early Egyptian kings but it had disappeared from Egypt as early as the reign of Rameses III (about 1190 B.C.), who hunted instead “wild ox” (probably the Cape buffalo) in forested areas of the Sudan, where there is no evidence that the aurochs ever lived. (A commemorative painting of one of these hunts clearly shows aurochs-like animals being hunted from chariots, but this may be artistic license or a traditional stereotype-the lions in similar paintings are certainly fanciful stereotypes.)","Among the many animal mummies found in Egypt there are a number of bubal or red hartebeest and Cape buffalo. Both of these animals fit the biblical description of “wild ox\", and the hartebeest certainly lived in Arabia and the land of Israel.","The Septuagint translates <em>re’em</em> as <em>monokerōs</em> which literally means “one-horned” (hence the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> “unicorn\") but is the ancient Greek word for rhinoceros. This translation needs to be taken seriously, because of its early date. The rhinoceros would have been an animal known to the Jews, since it was found in parts of Egypt. The ancient naturalist, Strabo of Amasia, who lived in the early part of the first century A.D., describes a rhinoceros that he saw in Egypt and refers to another naturalist of the time who had also described this animal. A variety of rhinoceros was found in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia at the time of the Exodus, and a second variety was found in Mesopotamia.","At the time of the Exodus then, the aurochs would have been found in the forests of southeast Europe, the far north of Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia, but not in Egypt, Canaan, the Arabian Peninsula, Sinai, or Syria. However, the oryx and the bubal hartebeest would have been plentiful and well known, and the Cape buffalo and rhinoceros would have been known too, at least by hearsay.","There is another aspect of the question that needs to be kept in mind. Throughout human history large, prominent animals have had symbolic importance, even in societies that would never have seen the animal. Thus the lion has been important in Chinese and British culture for centuries, but there is no evidence that lions have ever lived in China or Britain. Thus the aurochs, while it may be a rather improbable interpretation, cannot be ruled out entirely.","Four things can be said for certain about the <em>re’em</em>. It was a wild, untameable animal, it had horns, it was very strong, and it was appropriate to contrast or compare it with domestic cattle and with lions."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<strong>Aurochs:</strong> The Aurochs <em>Bos primigenius</em>, which is now extinct, was a very large animal, with prominent forward-pointing horns.

The bulls were dark brown or black, with a pale stripe down the spine, while the females were a lighter brown. The German zoos of Berlin, Munich, and Frankfurt have been fairly successful in genetic engineering experiments that have been aimed at reintroducing the aurochs’ original genetic characteristics, by selective breeding from domestic cattle that have the required characteristics.

Today it is almost extinct in Israel, but small numbers still exist in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The Greek and Latin words are general words for the wolf, including European species as well as the Syrian one."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The wolf is the ancestor of the German shepherd dog, and all similar breeds. The Syrian wolf, however, unlike the European and North American breeds, does not have long thick fur. It is a light brown color with a typical long face, and it is about the size of the German shepherd dog. It looks similar to the jackal, but is much bigger. This type of wolf lived singly, in pairs, or occasionally in a small family group of three or four animals; but sometimes, when prey was scarce, neighboring wolves would come together temporarily to hunt in cooperation with each other. The varieties in North America and Europe, on the other hand, come together in packs in the winter and stay together until well into the spring.","In biblical times the Syrian wolf took hares, small gazelle, and partridges as its main prey, but it was also a constant threat to sheep and goats. Only extremely rarely would it attack a human being. It was nowhere near as dangerous to humans as the lion or the bear. On the other hand, the Syrian wolf was not afraid of humans, and once it had killed a sheep, it would fiercely protect its kill. A group of men was required if it was to be chased away. It was extremely clever at avoiding traps that had been set for it. It hunted at night and located other wolves early in the evening by howling loudly.","These wolves did not stay in one area but roamed constantly. Shepherds could thus never be confident that there were no wolves nearby. They could appear unexpectedly at any time, even in the villages where they were often mistaken for dogs."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["To the biblical writers the wolf was a symbol of roaming, opportunistic, dangerous, fierce, and clever banditry. To refer to a person as a wolf would in some contexts indicate that he was a roaming, clever bandit, and in other contexts that he was a clever, dangerous opportunist. This latter usage usually referred to someone using a position of leadership for his own benefit at the expense of other people."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In Africa there are no wolves, but the Spotted Hyena <em>Crocula crocuta</em>, the Brown Hyena <em>Hyaena brunnea</em>, or the African Painted Hunting Dog <em>Lycaon pictus</em> are the local equivalents used in many translations. A problem with using these terms for the Syrian wolf is that these African animals may have a symbolic significance for the local readers which is very different from that intended by the biblical writers. For instance, the spotted hyena is associated with witchcraft in some societies. In cases where the local significance is sufficiently different, a footnote should be used to provide a guide to the readers.","In Argentina and Brazil the beautiful Maned Wolf <em>Chrysocyon jubatus</em> is a good local equivalent, or the Portuguese or Spanish words for wolf can be used. The coyote is another possible equivalent.","In India and in Central and Southeast Asia, the Indian (or red) wild dog, also known as the Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>, is likewise a good local equivalent for the wolf.","In areas where there are no animals equivalent to wolves, a phrase like “large wild dog” can be used, or a word may be borrowed from the dominant language of the area.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:27</span>: Three of the attributes of the wolf are associated with the tribe of Benjamin here. The first is the word often translated by the archaic English word “ravening\". This word literally means “tearing prey apart\", and so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> ’s “ravenous\", which in modern English means simply “very hungry\", is very weak. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> ’s “vicious” is much better. The second attribute is “devouring the prey\", which focuses on greed, and the third is “snatches a share” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) which emphasizes the opportunism. Since wolves hunt at night, the “snatching” occurs before the “devouring\", although the order is reversed in the Hebrew poetry. In many languages it is better style to use wording that retains the proper sequence. The translation should thus convey the meaning of the following:","Benjamin is a wolf that viciously tears its prey apart;","In the evening he snatches away his share,","In the morning he is still eating greedily.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 7:25; Judg 8:3; Ps 83:11</span> the word <em>ze’ev</em> is a proper name, possibly of a desert bandit chief.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 5:6; Hab 1:8; Zeph 3:3</span>: <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> ’s “evening wolves” is better read “wolves from the desert” or “wolves from the plain\". The Hebrew is taken by many scholars to mean “wolves of the Aravah\". The Aravah is the name of the broad rift valley that runs south from the Dead Sea almost to the Gulf of Aqaba, but the word can also mean a desert plain.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 7:17</span>: The well-known expression in English “wolves in sheep’s clothing” has been a problem for many translators, since sheep do not wear clothes. The meaning is obviously “wolves disguised as sheep\", “wolves trying to look like sheep\", or “wolves pretending to be sheep\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 20:29</span>: In this verse Paul is speaking metaphorically. The “fierce wolves” are unscrupulous and opportunistic people who will use their leadership positions in the congregation for their own gain, without thought for the congregation’s own welfare."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"זְאֵב","transliteration":"ze’ev","references":["Gen 49:27","Isa 11:6","Isa 65:25","Jer 5:6","Ezek 22:27","Hab 1:8","Zeph

unclean","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The basic principle in classifying animals and birds as clean or unclean was that if they ate unclean food they were themselves unclean. In cases of doubt about what they ate, they were also unclean. Thus a bird was unclean if it ate blood or meat with blood in it, garbage, unclean water creatures, or unclean insects. In addition, any bird that was associated with Egyptian or Canaanite gods, or that seemed somehow “unnatural” was also unclean.","Thus in the list of unclean birds we would expect to find eagles, vultures, and all other birds of prey such as buzzards, falcons, and hawks, scavengers like crows, kites, and seagulls, owls, storks, herons, and kingfishers, especially those that eat frogs, lizards, and snakes. Since the ibis was associated with Egyptian deities and eats worms and tadpoles, we would expect it too to be classified as unclean. Owls would be doubly unclean since they too were associated with an Egyptian god. Furthermore, knowing that ancient Israelites believed that bats, although classified as birds, were the unnatural offspring of a bird and a rat, we could expect bats also to be unclean.","However, we would not expect seed-eating or vegetarian birds to be considered unclean unless they were associated with heathen gods.","Unfortunately, in the biblical lists, there are many Hebrew words that are of very debatable meaning. Apart from a few, we are dealing only with probable rather than certain meanings. The following charts compare the lists in the various versions, omitting the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> which summarizes the twenty Hebrew words with fifteen in English. The first line in each chart gives the meaning of the word in modern Hebrew. The last line in each chart (ERH) represents the author’s own suggestion, based on a comparison of the English versions, ornithological checklists, commentaries, and other literature that discusses the linguistic derivation of the bird names. The merits of each suggestion are discussed in detail in the sections relating to the individual birds in the author’s suggested list.","In making decisions about the identity of these birds, one important factor that has been a guide is the organization of the list. The lists were obviously given to be memorized, and it is likely that they were arranged in a way that would help memorization. G. R. Driver used a similar method in his studies of these lists and was guided by what he believed was a descending order of size, so that bigger birds were mentioned before smaller ones within each general family. He decided that the three parts of the list were made up of fifteen land birds, three water birds, and two miscellaneous birds. Thus when facing a choice, he would opt for a bird smaller than the previous birds in that section of the list. However, the results of his method are sometimes very debatable, particularly as they presuppose that rather small differences between different types of owl would have been common knowledge.","The list suggested below is equally plausible in terms of the ornithology of the area, and it automatically results in a well organized list with a structure of a type found frequently in Hebrew literature, known as an “envelope.\"","Charts demonstrating the structures are given below the lists, and a discussion follows the charts.","<span class=\"image-placeholder\"

Hebrew texts, probably as an aid to memorization. In an envelope structure, the ideas are introduced in a sequence up to a midpoint, and then similar ideas are introduced in reverse order. At each point, there is some similarity between the corresponding items on both sides of the midpoint. The following charts show the structures:","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table6_en\">[Image: fauna-table6_en]</span>","Each name in the list probably refers to a particular bird as representing a group of similar birds. The list begins with the two largest birds of prey, vultures and eagles. Then follows a group of three birds of prey, each of which is smaller than the previous bird on the list—the smaller bearded vulture, the kite, and all kinds of falcon or hawk. Then comes all kinds of raven or crow in a group on its own, marking a transition in the list from the birds of prey to owls.","The next group consists of two owls, with the largest owl of all, the eagle owl first, followed by the slightly smaller eared owl. Then follows the seagull, in a group on its own, marking a transition to the midpoint.","The midpoint is formed by a group of two, all kinds of (sparrow) hawk and the little owl. These represent the smallest birds of prey and the smallest owls.","Then comes the osprey on its own, paired with the seagull in the envelope structure of the list, marking a transition back to a group of two more owls, the tawny owl and the barn owl. This group corresponds to the previous group of two owls. This time, however, the smaller is mentioned first, as one would expect on this side of the midpoint.","Then comes the jackdaw (or pelican or some other owl) on its own, corresponding to the crow on its own. If the modern Hebrew <em>qa’ak</em> (jackdaw) is accepted as the equivalent of the biblical <em>qa’at</em>, (since the name is representative of the sound the bird makes, this is a strong argument), rather than “pelican” or “owl,” the correspondence to “crow” is even more marked. This pairing is also seen in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:11</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 2:14</span>. The “jackdaw” marks a transition to waterside birds, just as the crow also marked a transition.","The waterside birds are in a group of three, corresponding to the three birds of prey mentioned above. Again, the smallest is mentioned first. While the Egyptian vulture is a bird of prey, it can be found scavenging on beaches, eating eggs of many of the waterside birds. It has a beak that resembles the beaks of many large seabirds, such as the albatross, shearwater, skua, and booby. Its posture when standing is also very similar to a gull’s, and from a distance it looks just like a large gull. It possibly represents all black-and-white waterside birds, since <em>racham</em> seems to be derived from a root meaning “black and white.\"","All kinds of heron probably represents all large waterside birds with big beaks, including the ibis and the cormorant, since the word <em>’anafah</em> seems to be derived from a root meaning “nose.\"","The final group of two is a miscellaneous group consisting of the hoopoe and the bat, which is classified here as a bird.","The inclusion of the ostrich in the list in some versions is highly unlikely, since ostriches are vegetarian and classified as clean. Their disappearance from Palestine is directly attributable to the fact that they were hunted and trapped for food.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0096_buzzard\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0096_buzzard.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0096_buzzard\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Buzzard — Steppe buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus)</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Common_Buzzard_(Steppe_Buzzard),_Buteo_buteo_vulpinus,_on_a_fence_along_the_R42,_Gauteng,_South_Africa_(32884487095).jpg • © Derek Keats from Johannesburg, South Africa, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0096_buzzard.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 14:11–Deut 14:18</span>: This list in the Hebrew Bible is basically the same as the list in Leviticus, with the addition of one extra bird called <em>ra’ah</em> and two slightly different spellings (<em>da’ah</em> becomes <em>dayah</em>, and <em>racham</em> becomes <em>rachamah</em>). This addition is treated as a scribal error in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, since in Hebrew <em>ra’ah</em> and <em>da’ah</em> look so much alike that it would be easy to read one for the other. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translates ra’ah as “glede,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> as “buzzard,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> as “falcon.\"","In the Hebrew text the list in Deuteronomy has a different arrangement from the list in Leviticus; the reason for the difference seems to be the additional bird. It is here located in the first group of medium-sized birds of prey, increasing the number of birds in the group from three to four. This group of four is matched by four birds in the corresponding group of waterside birds. The word for osprey <em>shalak</em> is here located within the group of waterside birds. The pattern of the list, however, is not as symmetrical as the Leviticus list, since there is now no word balancing the word for seagull. Finally, the order of the words for kite and falcon is reversed, as can be seen from the following chart:","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table7_en\">[Image: fauna-table7_en]</span>","If we accept the majority opinion that <em>ra’ah</em> is a scribal error, and thus omit it from the list, then it would seem to be best also to return the list to its original structure as found in Leviticus, as is done in some major translations.

For one thing, the root of the word <em>shalak</em> means “to throw or hurl\", which would indicate that the bird with this name “throws” itself down onto its prey, something cormorants do not do. They swim low in the water and dive underwater to hunt their prey. This led the late G. R. Driver to suggest the translation “fisher owl\", and this has been followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>. However, there are problems with this suggestion too. The fisher owl, or more correctly, the Brown Fish Owl “Scotopelia ceylonensis\", is not likely to have been a bird that was well known, and its fishing habits would only have been seen by fishermen on moonlit nights, and that very rarely. The Israelites were not yet a fishing people in the period of the Exodus.","In modern Hebrew <em>shalak</em> is the name given to the Osprey <em>Pandion haliaetus</em>, which is a type of fishing eagle that plunges into the water from a height and catches fish in its claws. Some Israeli scholars have suggested that it may have been the ancient name for the Smyrna Kingfisher <em>Halcyon smyrnensis</em>, or the Gannet <em>Sula bassana</em>, both of which drop down from a height onto their prey, which they catch underwater in their beaks.","Since there is so much doubt about the identification of this bird, the translation “osprey” seems to have as much, if not more, justification than “cormorant\".","See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:3.15\">3.15 Osprey</a>."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The White-necked Cormorant <em>Phala-crocorax carbo</em>, which is the most common type of cormorant in the Middle East, is a large bird with a long slim body and a long beak that is hooked at the tip.

This type of cormorant is found along the sea and lake coasts, along the larger rivers, and in swampy areas.

It dives and can swim quite a long way underwater hunting fish.","Like all cormorants its feathers are not waterproof, and this enables it to swim underwater easily. However, it also means that after diving or swimming for a while, a cormorant has to come out of the water to dry out its wings. Thus cormorants can often be seen perched on logs or rocks, with their wings spread out to dry.","During the daytime they can usually be found in small groups of four or five, but in the evening when they roost in trees they come together in large numbers and are very noisy. In seasons when large shoals of small fish swim near the surface, large numbers of black cormorants can often be seen flying fast and low above the water in long lines one behind the other, searching for such a shoal.

The phrase is thus translated as “swallow” by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, but as two birds by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>. (The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translators seem to have reversed the order of the two birds, giving “crane or a swallow\".) In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 8:7</span>, however, all versions treat the word as a common noun, although interpreting it differently.","The interpretation in Jeremiah of <em>‘agur</em> as “crane” has quite good support. For one thing the crane is one of the most obvious of the migrating birds passing over Israel, and thousands can be seen passing noisily overhead each year as they move from Europe and Asia to Africa for the summer and return again in March. They stay in Israel only for a few days and then move on. Second, the translation “crane” neatly preserves the structure and the images of the Hebrew poem. The structure here is what is referred to as a chiasmus. In this chiasmus four items are mentioned, with the first and last forming one pair and the middle two forming another: stork, dove, swift, crane. This is a common feature of Hebrew poetry. Here “stork” and “crane” are paired, and since both are passing migrants and both have long necks and legs and are about the same size, the pairing is well motivated. Third, but perhaps less important, <em>‘agur</em> is the modern Hebrew word for crane. Some Hebrew scholars relate the word to the verb <em>ga‘ar</em>, “to cry\", a reference to the noisy call of the crane.","The translations “thrush” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>) and “wryneck” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) result in a very poor poetic structure for the verse. Furthermore, while both of these small birds are migrants, their arrival in Israel is hardly noticeable, since they arrive in ones and twos and not in flocks. The wryneck is a passing migrant that stays only a short time in Israel. Even though some have argued that the song of the song thrush would be sufficient to announce its arrival, it should be borne in mind that this thrush sings mostly in spring, but it arrives in Israel at the end of autumn."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Cranes are large long-legged, long-necked birds, which are best known for their dancing displays.

They are highly intelligent and seem to enjoy flying. Often if there is a good thermal current of air, they will soar around in circles, riding the thermal and calling. Some varieties will congregate in great numbers in these thermals and circle around together. On sunny windy days they will sometimes spread their wings and ride the wind, not going anywhere, sometimes even anchoring themselves by hanging on to the end of a branch with one foot.

The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> translation of <em>‘orev</em> as “magpie” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 30:17</span> is puzzling, as it is common for ravens and crows to peck out the eyes of dead or dying animals.

In modern English the words are used almost interchangeably.

However, there are many exceptions to this general rule. For instance, shelters built for domestic pigeons are called “dovecotes\", and pies made from wild doves are called “pigeon pies\".","Pigeons and doves are both included in a bird family known scientifically as the <em>Colombidae</em>, consisting of well over two hundred species.

This bird was first domesticated around 4500 B.C. in Mesopotamia. By 2500 B.C. it was kept as a domestic bird in Egypt, and by 1200 B.C. there is evidence that its homing abilities were already well known. It is this bird that is the ancestor of the domestic homing pigeons that people keep, some of which have escaped, returned to the wild, and now populate city streets all over the world. The ledges of modern buildings are a good substitute for the rock ledges that were its original nesting sites. It is likely that the Canaanites and the Israelites also kept these birds for both food and sacrifice.

In fact since the end of World War II in 1945 the world’s population of vultures and eagles has been reduced by over sixty percent. This is due mainly to a) calcium deficiencies as a result of eating animals in which there were high concentrations of the insecticide DDT, b) eating poisoned rats, and c) the reduction in the amount of carrion due to both the disappearance of wild animals since the invention of the modern rifle, and the modern garbage disposal systems.","<em>Nesher</em>: As is the case with many Hebrew bird names, the word <em>nesher</em> refers both to one particular bird and to a general class of birds. It seems likely that nesher refers specifically to the largest of the local birds of prey, namely the Griffon Vulture <em>Gyps fulvus</em>, but since this word also refers to large birds of prey, it also has a general reference to all or any of them. Thus this category of large birds probably also includes the Lappet-faced Vulture <em>Torgos tracheliotus negevensis</em>, (now fairly uncommon, but previously very numerous), the Golden Eagle <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>, the Imperial Eagle <em>Aquila heliaca</em>, the Steppe Eagle <em>Aquila nipalensis</em>, and possibly the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <em>Aquila verreauxii</em>. The last mentioned bird has only been breeding in modern Israel in the last thirty-five years, but some ornithologists believe that it may have lived there in ancient times, since it is associated closely with the hyrax, its favorite prey. It is not mentioned by Canon Tristram.","<em>‘Ozniyah</em>: There is considerable doubt about the meaning of this word. Its meaning is basically derived from its position in the list of unclean birds, and this makes a type of vulture more likely than the osprey. Since the Black Vulture <em>Aegypius monachus</em> is slightly smaller than the lappet-faced vulture and the bearded vulture, this seems to be the most likely candidate. It probably represents eagles and buzzards of the same size as itself, that is, some of the eagles mentioned above. In modern Hebrew <em>‘ozniyah</em> is the name for the lappet-faced and black vultures.","<em>‘Ayit</em>: There is general agreement that the word <em>‘ayit</em> in the Bible is a word that includes in its meaning both eagles and vultures. However, it probably does not include smaller birds of prey, such as the hawk, sparrow hawk, or smaller falcons. In the contexts in which it occurs it is clear that carrion-eating birds of prey are meant, rather than all birds of prey. Therefore the English expression “birds of prey” is too inclusive, but the term “carrion birds\", used in some passages in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, is probably more correct.","The word <em>‘ayit</em> is usually taken to be derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to scream\", hence “the screamer\", and is obviously a bird in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 15:11</span> and other passages. However, there are also scholars who relate <em>‘ayit</em> to a different Hebrew root meaning “to attack greedily\".","In seventeenth century English, the word “fowls” was used for large or adult birds, and “birds” was used for smaller birds or chicks. The verb “to raven” meant to tear meat off a carcass, so the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> expression “ravenous birds\"(<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 12:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 39:4</span>) did not mean “hungry birds” but rather “birds that tear meat off carcasses\".","<em>Peres</em>, a word derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to tear apart” or “to break\", probably refers to the Bearded Vulture or Lammergeir <em>Gypaëtus barbatus</em>, which looks much like an eagle. It probably represents a grouping of eagles and vultures slightly smaller than those mentioned above under nesher and would include the Black-breasted Snake Eagle (also called the Short-toed Eagle or the Black-chested Harrier Eagle) <em>Circaetus gallicus</em> (alternatively <em>Circaetus pectoralus</em>) and the Booted Eagle <em>Hieraaetus pennatus</em>, as well as one or two others.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Vulture — Egyptian vulture</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Egyptian_Vulture_01.jpg • © michael clarke stuff (Egyptian Vulture 01), CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><em>Racham</em> refers to something that is black and white.

In modern Hebrew <em>racham</em> is the name for the Egyptian vulture, and this seems to be the bird intended by the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> translation “white vulture\". <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> ’s “geir-eagle” is an old word for vulture.","The Egyptian vulture is smaller than the other vultures mentioned above.

The rest of the body and wings are white with black wing tips. In flight the body and the front half of the wings are white, with the wing tips and the back half of the wings black.","While this vulture does eat carrion, it is usually the scraps dropped by larger vultures, since its beak is not strong enough to tear skin and meat easily. It usually scavenges scraps on beaches or rubbish dumps and eats the eggs of ground-nesting waterside birds such as plovers, sandpipers, curlews, and others, which it breaks by knocking them with a large stone.","<em>Aetos</em>: This is the usual Greek word for any kind of eagle.","<em>Aquila</em>: This is the usual Latin word for any kind of eagle."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["True eagles have feathers on the lower part of their legs, but vultures, snake-eagles, hawks, and others usually have no such feathers.

It has a thick hooked black beak. Its head and neck are covered in fine down, and it always looks as though it is frowning. It has a tuft of feathers on its back between its shoulders. The head, neck, and chest are gray and fawn, and its back is dark brown with darker feathers on the edges of its wings. When it is soaring, its body and the leading edges of its wings appear light brown with a broad dark band on the trailing edge of the wings. Like all true vultures, it has featherless legs.","Griffons live in fairly large groups and roost and nest together on high rock ledges, and, like most other vultures of large size, they have to wait until mid-morning when there is warm air rising up from the ground before they can fly. They then soar in spirals, going higher and higher.","They have very specialized eyes that enable them to see great distances. A proverb quoted in the Talmud says, “A vulture in Babylon sees a carcass in Israel.” They keep watch to find any dead or dying animals, and at the same time they keep track of other vultures flying nearby. They soar fairly slowly, without beating their wings. As soon as one stops spiraling and heads toward its prey, it gathers speed quickly in a shallow dive, still not beating its wings, but often reaching high speeds. The Hebrew name <em>nesher</em> may reflect the swishing sound made by its wings when it is flying this fast. Other vultures will notice this movement and will start to follow.","In African countries where both griffon and lappet-faced vultures live, griffons usually arrive at a carcass in fairly large numbers, with the lappet-faced vultures arriving in pairs. Often a dead cow will attract twenty griffons or more and perhaps four lappet-faced vultures. It is likely that this ratio was the case in ancient Israel too.","The griffons attack the stomach and other soft parts of the carcass and thrust their heads deep into the body to eat the liver and other soft organs before starting on the softer meat, eating “from the inside out.” They eat very quickly and can consume a kilogram (2 pounds) of meat in about two minutes. After gorging themselves it is difficult for them to fly, and they need to run and hop along the ground before getting airborne. If there is no obvious danger, they prefer to remain on the ground or to perch on logs or in nearby trees after eating.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Vulture — Lappet-faced vulture</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2012-lappet-faced-vulture.jpg • © Yathin sk, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><strong>Lappet-faced vulture</strong>: This vulture is almost as big as the griffon in terms of height and wingspan but has a lighter build. They live singly or in pairs in the Negev and roost and nest in the tops of flat-topped trees such as acacias. The lappet-faced vulture has a yellowish beak, which is thicker and stronger than that of the griffon, and this enables it to eat skin, sinews, and tough meat. The head, face, and neck are covered with bare red skin. The head and neck have thick wrinkles. The rest of the body is dark brown or black with white thighs and shoulders. When they are soaring they appear to be uniformly black except for a thin white streak on the leading edge of the wings, with the white thighs (usually referred to by bird watchers as their “white pants\") clearly visible.","At a carcass they feed “from the outside in,” tearing the skin and eating it before starting on the meat. Lappet-faced vultures are very aggressive and dominate the griffons at a carcass they are sharing. Although carrion is their main food, they also sometimes kill their own prey, mainly small mammals such as young gazelles or hares.","<strong>Black vulture</strong>: The black vulture, as its name suggests, is black all over apart from the bare head and neck, which are a bluish gray. When viewed from below it appears completely black.","<strong>Large eagles</strong>: The golden, imperial, and Verreaux’s eagles mentioned above are all very large and have a wingspan of at least 2 meters (6 feet). They are not mainly scavengers, but may occasionally join vultures at a carcass. Generally their prey is small mammals, such as baby gazelles, lambs, hyraxes, hares, and young ibexes, as well as occasional game birds such as partridges and doves.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0065_beardedvulture\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0065_beardedvulture.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0065_beardedvulture\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Vulture — Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus)</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gaensegeier2.jpg • © Hswaton, CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0065_beardedvulture.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><strong>Bearded vulture</strong>: Also known as the lammergeir, this bird is unique among vultures, as it has feathered legs like an eagle.

Its back and wings are dark brown. In flight it is easily recognized by its coloring and its large diamond shaped tail. It usually feeds when other vultures have eaten, and it has the unique habit of carrying bones high into the air and then dropping them onto a large rock to break them so that it can eat the marrow and the bone fragments.

Especially important is their ability to fly great distances at high speed, without even beating their wings. Both Egyptian and Assyrian deities had the eagle or vulture as their symbol, and this, as well as their diet of meat, meant that these birds were “unclean” to the Jews. The famous mummy of Tutankhamen, the young Egyptian king, was found with a large collar made of gold and colored glass adorning his neck and shoulders, in the form of a flying vulture representing the goddess Nekhbet. The eagle in Scripture is also a symbol of protection, and in Deuteronomy the eagle is a metaphor for God.","As carrion-eating birds of prey, eagles and vultures symbolized death in battle, in which the corpses were not buried. They are listed among the unclean birds.","The vulture or eagle was a symbol of healthy, long life. In actual fact these birds can live for a great many years. One fairly reliable report from Austria refers to an eagle kept in captivity for 104 years. Some scholars relate the Hebrew association of long life and the eagle to the ancient Arabian myth about the phoenix, usually portrayed as some sort of eagle, which flew to the sun every five hundred years, was consumed by the sun’s fire, and emerged reborn from its own ashes.","By the time of the New Testament the eagle, besides the symbolism mentioned above, had also become a symbol of the power of the Roman Empire."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The context will usually indicate whether vultures or eagles are intended by the author. When there is reference to speed and swooping down on the prey, the eagle is intended, but when there is reference to eating dead bodies, the vulture is intended. When the text speaks of flying high or nesting in safety on high cliffs, either eagles or vultures fit the context.","Three linguistic situations are possible: a) Languages in which the same word is used for both vultures and eagles (for example, Lisu, Lahu, and other Tibeto-Burman languages). Here there is no need to differentiate between them, except where both Hebrew words appear together. b) Languages in which there are no generic words for vultures or eagles, but each individual subspecies has its own name (as with many southeastern Bantu languages). In these cases it is best to choose the biggest vulture or eagle for <em>nesher</em> and a slightly smaller one for <em>peres</em>. c) Languages in which there are two generic words, one for vultures and another for eagles (as is the case in English). Here the context will determine the choice.","Care should be taken in those contexts where the nest is referred to as high on a cliff face, since some species of vulture and eagle nest in trees. In these cases a cliff-nesting alternative should be chosen, even if it is a smaller bird of prey.","<em>‘Ozniyah</em> is probably a word for the black vulture or a type of medium-sized eagle. An expression meaning “small vulture” is probably the best equivalent.","Another name for an eagle or vulture of similar size as the black vulture can be used in the lists of unclean birds for <em>‘ozniyah</em>, or it can be included, along with <em>peres</em>, in a general expression covering both fairly large vultures and eagles.","<em>‘Ayit</em> In languages that do not have a single word including both eagles and vultures, but where both types of bird are found, such as in Africa and the Middle East, it is better to use a simple phrase meaning “eagles and vultures.” A phrase such as “scavenging birds of prey,” or simply “vultures,” could also be used.","True vultures are not found in the Americas or Australasia, but a word for “buzzards,” or, in the case of the Americas, “condors” can substitute for “vultures.” Elsewhere a phrase such as “eagles that eat dead things” or a borrowed word can be used.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 12:9</span>: The phrase <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> in this verse is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey.” Others take <em>tsavu‘a</em> to mean “hyena” and (taking <em>‘ayit</em> to be derived from a root meaning “attack greedily\") they interpret <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> to mean either “greedy/scavenging hyenas,” “prey for hyenas,” or “carrion for hyenas.” These latter interpretations make better sense in the context than “speckled bird of prey.” See <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:2.19\">2.19 Hyena</a>.","Translators may at times need to keep local cultural conditioning in mind. In some cultures vultures and eagles carry very different associations in popular thought, the one being considered nasty, dirty, and generally negative, while the other is a symbol of power and nobility. While the latter symbolism is found in Scripture, it is usually associated with the <em>nesher</em>, which most commonly indicates the vulture rather than the eagle. So, for example, one might translate as “I carried you on the wings of vultures” (see the discussion below). However, this would evoke a wrong response from most Western readers. Where such symbolism exists and where the context allows, it will be preferable to render “eagle\".","<em>Peres</em>: The bearded vulture is found in the mountainous regions of southern Europe, Central and South Asia, and eastern and southern Africa. The medium-sized short-toed eagle is found throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The booted eagle is found all over Europe, Asia, and Africa. Elsewhere, the name for a medium-sized vulture or eagle can be used to translate <em>peres</em>.","In Africa there are many vultures closely related to the griffon vulture, and the lappet-faced vulture is common in most areas of the African continent. The African griffons include the White-backed Vulture <em>Gyps africanus</em> (alternately <em>Gyps bengalensis</em>), which nests in trees, the Cape Vulture <em>Gyps coprotheres</em>, and Ruppell’s Vulture <em>Gyps ruppelli</em>. The local word for any of these would be a good equivalent in contexts where the text refers to vultures.","Griffons are also found in central and eastern Europe and on the Indian sub-continent. The condors of Latin America and California would be local equivalents. The Wedge-tailed Eagle <em>Aquila audax</em> of Australia would be an equivalent there.","Golden and imperial eagles are found in most of western Europe as well as Israel.","African equivalents of the golden and imperial eagles would be the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <em>Aquila verreauxii</em> and the Martial Eagle <em>Polemaetus bellicosus</em>.","The Steppe Eagle <em>Aquila nipalensis migrates</em> across Israel to as far south as the northern parts of South Africa. It is also found in eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and South Asia.","In North America the Bald Eagle <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em> would be an equivalent in some contexts of the Hebrew <em>nesher</em>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 19:4</span>: The expression “I carried you on eagles’ wings” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) involves a metaphor that has been taken literally by readers in many languages. However, the text does not mean that eagles carried the Israelites to Sinai. Rather the metaphor refers to God’s protection, speed, and power and means “I brought you here as if I had been a flying eagle carrying you.\"","Some commentaries have quoted an often repeated but unsubstantiated statement to the effect that the Israelites believed that eagles carry their young on their wings. Some commentaries have even claimed that naturalists have actually seen eagles doing this. There is no independent evidence for this belief apart from two biblical passages of which this is one, and none of the naturalists who have specialized in the observation of eagles has ever reported this kind of behavior. These commentaries have actually misinterpreted the Hebrew idiom “on wings,” which does not mean “on the upper surface of the wings” but rather “in flight.\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 28:49</span>: Since the context indicates that the <em>nesher</em> in this verse is attacking the disobedient nation of Israel rather than devouring the dead nation, the word should be interpreted as a large eagle (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) rather than as a vulture (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 32:10; Deut 32:11; Deut 32:12</span>: There are a number of problems in verse 11. In the Hebrew poem verses 10 and 11 are closely linked, so that the main thought of verse 10 is continued in verse 11. In verse 10 the last three verbs are “shielded or, encircled, cared for, guarded.” In this context the translation of verse 11 as “stirs up its nest” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) is not likely. “Watches over its nest” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) is a better exegesis, but this verb is often translated elsewhere as encourage so “encourages its nestlings” is entirely possible (see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>).","All of the English versions misrepresent how an eagle teaches its young to fly, probably because they accept the hypothetical myth mentioned above, namely that eagles carry their young on their wings.","What actually happens is that young eagles are shown by their parents how to set their wings by spreading them when the wind blows, while holding on to the side of the nest. Eventually when the young eagles have mastered this, they let go and ride the wind out of the nest. At this stage the parent eagles are usually nearby, circling overhead.","The Hebrew text, if the myth hypothesis is rejected, is actually open to a very different interpretation that is in accordance with what really happens. This interpretation has some scholarly support, but has not yet been mentioned in any commentary or translation.

The White Pelican <em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em>, which is the pelican seen most often in the land of Israel, lives in large rivers, lakes, lagoons, and oceans. They are passing migrants in Israel, staying only a few weeks in autumn. They stop briefly in the Huleh and Eilat areas, as they move from the Black Sea, the Danube Delta, and the Caspian Sea to Africa. No place in the whole of the Middle East could be called a “dwelling place of pelicans\". To do so would be to indicate that the place has become a wetland or full of suitable lakes well-stocked with fish.","Some sort of owl seems more likely, and most modern English translations follow Driver’s suggestion in this regard. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> have “horned owl\". This is not a species of owl but a much broader classification referring to a family of owls that have prominent ear tufts. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> have an even more general term, “desert owl\". There is no such family or species of owl, and the phrase simply means an owl found in the desert.","However, another interesting suggestion has been the jackdaw.

It probably represents a grouping of eagles and buzzards the same size as itself. In modern Hebrew <em>‘ozniyah</em> is the name for the lappet-faced and black vultures.

The fisher owl, or more correctly, the Brown Fish Owl <em>Scotopelia ceylonensis</em> is not likely to have been well known; its fishing habits would only have been seen by fishermen on moonlit nights, and that very rarely.","In modern Hebrew <em>shalak</em> is the name given to the Osprey <em>Pandion haliaetus</em>, a type of fishing eagle that plunges into the water from a height and catches fish in its claws.

In modern Hebrew the sand partridge is still called <em>qore’</em>, but in biblical times all three types of partridge were probably referred to by this name. The name means “the caller\", a reference to the ringing crowing of the males, typically while standing on top of a rock.","Partridges were hunted with stones, slings, and throwing sticks, and were also caught in snares. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 26:20</span> David likens himself to a partridge being hunted. This is a very apt simile, since he had been moving from one refuge to another, just as a partridge flies short distances from cover to cover when being chased. He had also been hiding in the same rocky hills that partridges inhabit near En Gedi.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 11:30</span> there is reference to “a decoy partridge in a cage\". This refers to a practice still common in many parts of the world. A male partridge is captured and the caged bird is left in an area where it is known there are partridges, or it is taken from the cage and tethered to a bush by its leg. Grain is scattered around and slip noose snares are set. Toward sundown the captive partridge begins to call, and this attracts other partridges, which begin to feed on the grain and are snared.

Since the word is not a common one, it is only the contexts of these two verses that provide clues to its meaning. It is the Isaiah passage that gives the most contextual clues, but even there, there are some words with very obscure meaning. Most commentaries and translations agree about the first two verbs but about little else in the verse. If we transliterate rather than translate the disputed Hebrew words in , a fairly literal translation of the first half of the verse reads:","There a <em>qipoz</em> will nest, will lay eggs, will break open, and <em>dagrah</em> under her shadow.","All English versions translate <em>bak‘ah</em> (\"break open\") as “hatch them\", and this leads some to translate <em>dagrah</em> as “gather her brood\". However, it should be noted that this interpretation involves a change of implied object from “eggs” to “chicks” or “brood\".","If the translation of <em>dagar</em> were done consistently, one would expect that the Jeremiah passage would be translated:","a) As a partridge cares for/gathers chicks it did not hatch . . . .","Only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> in fact do this.

This would seem to indicate two possible translations of the verb in this verse. The first is “lay eggs\". This is what leads to interpretation b) above and to the two very different interpretations being given for <em>dagar</em> in what are basically identical contexts. However, the noun form <em>yeled</em>, when used of birds, does not refer to their eggs but to their chicks (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 38:41</span>), and this would justify the second possible translation, namely “to hatch chicks\".","Interpretation b) is supported by Jewish Midrashic traditions and by most commentaries and Bible dictionaries. These sources usually contain a reference to “a popular but incorrect belief that partridges steal eggs from other birds.” However, in the course of the research for this Handbook, this assumption was found to be very dubious. Many scholars now question its validity. The major problem with the traditional interpretation is that the only supporting evidence for the “popular but erroneous belief” is this one possible translation of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>. The argument is thus circular: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span> must be interpreted in the light of a myth; the source for the myth is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>.","In trying to provide some hypothetical basis for the “popular but erroneous belief,” reference is made to the fact that most partridges indigenous to the land lay twelve or more eggs in a clutch, and this might have led to the belief that partridges collect eggs from each other. However, as mentioned above, there is no independent evidence at all for such a belief. Partridges and their eggs were, and are, a regular and important food source, and it is hard to believe that the ancient prophets did not know where the eggs came from.","There are three possible alternative interpretations of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>, none of which corresponds to interpretation b) above.","The first alternative results from an interpretation of <em>dagar</em> as meaning “to sit in a broody state while incubating eggs.” This is the meaning given as a gloss in Abraham Even-Shoshan’s <em>A New Concordance of the Old Testament</em>. <em>Yalad</em> is taken to mean “lay eggs\". The verse can then be translated:","c) “Like a partridge that sits brooding but has not laid eggs ....\"","This could then be taken as a reference to the habit partridges have of sitting motionless in the shade, or as one of their means of defence. In situations of danger from eagles or hawks, they make use of their fantastic camouflage and sit absolutely still for long periods in what is almost a state of trance. When sitting like this one can approach to within a few feet of the bird. The point of the simile would be that the man who has become rich by unjust means is like a partridge that only <em>appears</em> to be productive. No commentator that I know of has raised this possible interpretation, probably because it is difficult to relate to the last half of the verse, which is literally “they will leave him half-way through his life.\"","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:15</span> the last phrase would then be translated as “sits brooding in the shade.” (In response to the suggestion that the Hebrew should be altered to read <em>betseyha</em> “her eggs” instead of <em>betsilah</em> “in/under her shade\", it has been pointed out by many scholars that the sequence of verbs which then results is improbable. The existing text yields “makes a nest ... lays ... hatches ... sits brooding her eggs.\")","The second possible alternative interpretation follows the same understanding of <em>dagar</em>, but <em>yalad</em> is taken to mean “hatch chicks\":","d) “Like a partridge that sits brooding on eggs but does not get to hatch them ....\"","This would refer to the fact that a large percentage of the numerous eggs that a partridge lays were, and are, collected by people or stolen by other animals such as jackals and mongooses, birds such as crows, or monitor lizards. It is interesting that Canon Tristram mentions finding a partridge nest containing twenty-eight eggs, and that a particular Bedouin camp he was associated with collected over eight hundred partridge eggs in a single breeding season. The collecting of eggs is mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:14</span>, and it is likely that partridge eggs were the most common and easiest to find.","Rendering d) is the interpretation adopted by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>. The point of the comparison would then seem to be that getting rich by dishonest means is as futile as a partridge laying eggs that others steal. The inference seems to be that ill-gotten wealth will be taken away, either by the authorities or perhaps by God. This is the interpretation preferred by a growing number of scholars. It relates fairly well to the last half of the verse.","The third possible alternative interpretation is that followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>. It involves interpreting <em>dagar</em> as “to gather or mother chicks like a hen does\", and <em>yalad</em> as “to hatch chicks\":","e) “Like a partridge that gathers chicks it did not hatch ....\"","The reference would then be to the fact that in a flock or covey of rock partridges the hens do not differentiate between their own chicks and the other chicks in the flock. (This is not true of some of the other partridge species). Rock partridge hens can be seen caring for as many as fifty chicks at a time. As the chicks grow, their ties with the hens weaken considerably, and when the expanding flock divides up into smaller flocks the offspring often move away. Thus the imagery in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span> is carried by this interpretation right through the whole verse, and the clause “they will leave him halfway through his life” is very pertinent.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:15</span> can then be interpreted consistently as “There the <em>qipoz</em> will make her nest, lay eggs, hatch them, and gather her chicks under her protecting shade.” Of the options e) seems to be the best, suiting the contexts and resulting in a consistent translation of the two occurrences of <em>dagar</em>. However, a footnote explaining the behavior of rock partridge hens seems necessary in order to convey the inference.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 15:19</span> the place name En-Haqore [Hakkore] should be taken to mean “Well of the Caller” rather than “Well of the Partridge\", since the name commemorates Samson’s calling to God for help."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קֹרֵא","transliteration":"qore’","references":["1 Sam 26:20","Jer 17:11"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κάρταλλος","transliteration":"kartallos","references":["Sir 11:30"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["1 Sam 26:20","Jer 17:11","Sir 11:30"],"crossRefs":["REALIA:1.4.3"]},{"key":"3.19","book":"fauna","title":"Quail","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שְׂלָו","transliteration":"selav","references":["Exod 16:13","Num 11:31","Num 11:32","Ps 105:40"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ὀρτυγομήτρα","transliteration":"ortugomētra","references":["Wis 16:2","Wis 19:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"coturnix","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 1:15"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0738_quails\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0738_quails.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0738_quails\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Quail</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/photos/bird-quail-feathers-plumage-ave-5871357/ • Graham light, CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0738_quails.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>There is total agreement among versions and commentators that this is the Common Quail <em>Coturnix coturnix</em>.

They fly at great speed for long periods on end, twisting and turning, usually in fairly large groups. They catch insects in the air as they fly. The Hebrew name <em>deror</em> is derived from a word meaning “free,” probably a reference to this wonderful ability to fly freely at speed, swooping, diving, and turning, with no need to stop for a rest. The name <em>sus</em> or <em>sis</em> refers to the swishing sound the fast-flying swifts make in the air as they pass.","The common swift makes a noise described in many bird books as a “high-pitched scream\", especially in the breeding season, but it also keeps up a noisy twittering almost constantly, especially near the places where it roosts. This is also a common feature of some other types of swift and many types of martin.","The common swift, house martin, European swallow, red-rumped swallow, and pale crag martin all make their nests under overhangs on rock faces, in caves, or in human structures, such as buildings and the underside of bridges. (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 84:4</span> speaks of the <em>deror</em> making its nest in the Temple.) The swifts make their nests out of grass and leaves cemented together with their saliva (it is the nest of a swift that is collected by Chinese people for the famous bird’s nest soup). The swallows and martins make their nests out of small pellets of mud mixed with grass. Both types of nest are bonded to a rock or wall, usually close to an overhanging projection such as a roof.","Swallows and swifts are amazing migrants. Some species migrate from central Africa to the Far East and to parts of southwestern China, others move from northern Russia and Scandinavia to South Africa. One group of swallows is known to have covered more than 12 ,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) in thirty-five days. When gathering for migration, or when stopping briefly on their way, they can often be seen in the hundreds of thousands. In Bangkok in one night, university students counted nearly two million migrating swallows roosting on the telephone and power lines in the city. They were gone the following day."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The references listed above, all of which are poetic, indicate that these birds were noted for a) their regular migration, b) their unending flight, c) the fact that they build nests in human dwellings, and, in the case of the swift, d) their unending, and perhaps sad-sounding noise."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Swifts, swallows, and martins are found worldwide.

Snakes</strong>","There are at least forty snake species found in the Middle East and adjacent areas of Africa. Some are small, being only about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, while others may reach 2 meters (6 feet) in length. They live in a variety of habitats, from desert sand to rocky wadis, thick undergrowth, and river banks, with different species preferring their own type of environment. The snakes of this region include representative species of all of the major snake families except the rattlesnake.","Many of these Middle Eastern snake species are non-poisonous, but the biblical writers, in common with many other peoples around the world, had the traditional belief that all were poisonous. In fact this region has a higher proportion of poisonous species than most other areas of the world. Like many other people too, the Jews and early Christians had a great fear of snakes of all kinds. Thus there is no reference in the Bible to harmless snakes.","It is unlikely that the biblical writers would have differentiated between many of the individual species. It is more likely that they only made a distinction between the types of snake that were most common. There were, of course, also general words that included all types.","Some scholars claim that the ancient biblical writers believed that when a snake bit someone, the snake’s tongue stung him at the same time, and that it was this sting that poisoned the man. Others, however, believe that while the poison was certainly associated with the snake’s tongue, the verb “sting” was in fact just the Hebrew way of referring to the rather special way a snake bites. This would be supported by the fact that in many languages around the world the word for a snake’s bite is different from the usual word “bite\". In these languages the words used are equivalent to “peck\", “stab\", “burn\", “sting\", and such like.","In fact, as most readers will know, snake poison is produced not by the tongue but by glands situated between the snake’s mouth and its eyes, and the poison is conveyed through tube-like vessels to the fangs, which are hollow in some species and deeply grooved in others. When the snake bites, muscles force the liquid poison from the glands into the fangs, thus injecting the poison into the victim.","All snakes are carnivorous, with some small species eating insects and worms, while the rest may eat frogs, mice, birds and bird eggs, lizards, and other snakes. Without exception this food is swallowed whole. The snake is able to dislocate its jaw, making it possible to open the jaw very wide, and the muscles and skin around the neck are flexible enough to allow the prey to pass. However, snakes eat only very seldom, and some larger snakes are known to have gone many months without food. Even those that eat more frequently do so only every three or four days.","All snakes lay eggs, but in the case of vipers the eggs are kept inside the female until they hatch. There are thus snakes that appear to give birth to live young, as well as those that lay clutches of eggs.","Snake charming has a very long history and was well known in Bible times. The snake usually chosen for this purpose was the Egyptian cobra, which is a large snake with the ability to spread its neck into a flat hood when it adopts the upright threatening posture typical of the cobra family. It also has striking markings on the hood. The charmer uses a flute-like musical instrument that he plays. The snake begins to emerge from a basket or clay pot and is then hypnotized by the charmer, and begins to mimic the charmer’s movements. It was believed that it was the charmer’s magical music that produced this effect. Modern experiments have shown that the cobra is actually deaf but is sensitive to the vibrations produced by the music. However, it is not the music alone which produces the trance, but the swaying motions that the charmer makes with the flute.","The various Hebrew words for snake all contain sounds similar to the puffs and hisses made by snakes. This makes it difficult to associate a name with a particular species. However, with some of the names that occur repeatedly, the contexts help somewhat to make a tentative identification of the type of snake.","<strong>B. Lizards</strong>","There are at least forty species and subspecies of lizard found in the land of Israel, and the Hebrew words, rather than differentiating between them all, seem to make distinctions only between the more obvious main groups of species. Most of these names occur only once, in the list of unclean foods in Leviticus, so identification is only very speculative. In spite of this, however, there is some agreement among scholars about the types of lizard mentioned. This is because the Hebrew words are fairly descriptive, and one can identify a type of lizard with the descriptive name in many cases.","Rather than trying to list the different kinds, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> sums up the whole list in as “lizards\". As a last resort translators can use this option, but since the Hebrew list is specific, an attempt should first be made to find specific equivalents in the translation."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.2","book":"fauna","title":"Reptiles (crawling and creeping things)","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"זחל","transliteration":"zachal","references":["Deut 32:24","Mic 7:17"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"רֶמֶשׂ","transliteration":"remes","references":["Gen 1:24","Gen 1:25","Gen 1:26","Gen 6:7","Gen 6:20","Gen 7:14","Gen 7:23","Gen 8:19","Gen 9:3","1 Kgs 5:13","Ps 104:25","Ps 148:10","Ezek 8:10","Ezek 38:20","Hos 2:20","Hab 1:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֶׁרֶץ","transliteration":"sherets","references":["Gen 7:21","Lev 5:2","Lev 11:10","Lev 11:20","Lev 11:21","Lev 11:23","Lev 11:29","Lev 11:31","Lev 11:41","Lev 11:42","Lev 11:43","Lev 11:44","Lev 22:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἑρπετόν","transliteration":"herpeton","references":["Acts 10:12","Acts 11:6","Rom 1:23","Jas 3:7","Wis 11:15","Wis 17:9","Sir 10:11","EpJer 1:19"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"reptilis","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 6:53"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The Hebrew words <em>zachal</em> and <em>remes</em> literally mean “creeping [things]” or “crawling [things]\", which is the Hebrew way of referring to small unclean creatures, reptiles in particular.

It is impossible to identify the actual type of snake referred to, and most scholars take this word to have the same meaning in these particular contexts as the more usual word <em>nachash</em>. In other words it is an alternative word for snakes in general. See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:7.2\">7.2 Dragon, sea monster</a>.","Another possibility has been suggested by Jewish scholars in their commentaries on Exodus. They note that, while in Moses’ rod is said to turn into a <em>nachash</em> in the desert, along the banks of the Nile (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 7:0</span>) Aaron’s rod turns into a <em>tanin</em>, which they interpret to mean “crocodile\". Each miracle would then be appropriate to its setting: a snake in the desert, a crocodile by the river. One scholar also points out that in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 29:3</span> Pharaoh is called “the great crocodile [<em>tanim</em> &lt; <em>tanin</em> ] that lies in the midst of his rivers,” and that the Egyptians used to worship the crocodile. While no translation has adopted this proposal, it should be given serious consideration.","The problematic Hebrew word <em>qipoz</em>, which occurs only in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:15</span>, has been associated by some scholars with a snake. The English Revised Version has “arrowsnake\", and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> has “viper\". Rather strangely, the name “arrowsnake” is associated with <em>qipoz</em> because the word is said to be derived from a verb <em>qafaz</em> (<em>qafats</em>), which means “to leap.” <em>Fauna and Flora of the Bible</em> even has this note: “The arrowsnake is a serpent which is able to coil itself back and dart forward quickly like an arrow, or to leap from a tree.” In fact the arrowsnake <em>Eryx jaculus</em>, more correctly called the javelin sand boa, is so-called, not because it can leap, but because it has a small head that is hard to distinguish from its narrow tail; that is, it is pointed at both ends of its fairly thick body like a javelin. It belongs to the category of snakes called constrictors, which coil around their prey and suffocate them by crushing the breath out of them. It lives in the sand and among rocks, rather than in trees, and is slow-moving. It reaches about 75 centimeters (30 inches) in length.

From the contexts it is possible in one or two places to identify the particular species, and it is possible that the various Hebrew words actually refer to particular species. However, associating the various words with the corresponding species is largely conjecture, even though based on careful deduction.","The most common vipers in Israel are the Palestinian Viper <em>Vipera palaestina</em>, the Carpet Viper <em>Echis coloratus</em>, the Sand Viper <em>Cerastes vipera</em>, and the Horned Viper <em>Cerastes cerastes</em>. The Palestinian viper is the largest of these vipers and is found in a variety of habitats, from the woods of the north to the desert’s edge. Since this is the most inhabited area, people are bitten by this snake more than any other. The other four vipers mentioned are found in desert areas, but in slightly different habitats. The sand viper and the horned viper live in the sand, while the carpet viper lives in gravelly areas and among rocks. It often camouflages itself among dried leaves.","The desert vipers, when moving in sand, cannot move in the normal way, so they adopt a movement known as “sidewinding\". They do this by moving a coil sideways to a position in front of the head, then the snake moves its head and the front part of its body in the air, arching over the sand as far as it can reach before falling back onto the sand. Then it repeats the movement again. This is done at some speed, and the snake moves diagonally across the sand surprisingly quickly, although not as quickly as another snake moving normally. The parallel elongated S-shaped marks it leaves in the sand look as though it has moved in a series of jumps, since they seem not to be connected. It is generally accepted that this motion caused the biblical writers to refer to these snakes as “flying\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Vipers are different from other snakes mainly in that they give birth to live offspring. The females retain their eggs in a special sac in their bodies, and when the eggs hatch the small snakes emerge from the mother. The larger vipers produce as many as sixty young snakes at a time, while the smaller sand vipers have smaller broods of about twelve to fifteen. This is what John the Baptist refers to by his well-known phrase “brood of vipers\".","The vipers have long hinged fangs located in the front of their mouths. These fangs fold back as they close their mouths. When striking, vipers have to open their mouths very wide in order to get these fangs into the required position.","The carpet viper (also known as the saw-scaled viper) was very numerous in biblical Israel, and in most other areas of its range (it is found in a broad continuous band from West Africa to South and Central Asia). It is likely that this was the <em>saraf</em>, a name derived from a finite verb meaning “to burn something,” a reference to the burning effect of its poisonous bite.","This snake occurs in two slightly different forms. The most common type in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula is a reddish brown snake with a pale underside. It has a row of pale blotches arranged side-by-side in pairs all the way down its back. These blotches give it excellent camouflage. It grows to about 80 centimeters (32 inches) in length, and its head is smaller and its body thinner than most typical vipers. It is very easily provoked and quite an aggressive snake. It is mainly active in the daytime, as it can stand higher temperatures than many other snakes. It lives in desert and grassland areas and feeds on jerboas, mice, and mole rats. Its venom, like that of most vipers, is highly poisonous, attacking both the blood vessels and the blood corpuscles, but, like the poison of most other vipers, it is slow-acting.","Carpet vipers move like other snakes on firm surfaces, but in sand they move by side-winding.","The horned viper is one of the two common sand vipers found in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. As the species name suggests, these vipers live in sand. They have scales arranged so that with small sideways movements they can bury themselves in the sand, with only their eyes and nostrils showing. This is how they lie in wait for their prey, mainly jerboas and other small rodents. When the sand gets too hot for comfort, they bury themselves even deeper, or they move to the shade of a stone.","The horned viper has an unusually elongated scale above each eye, the “horns\". It is a light brown mottled color and moves by sidewinding. It has a broad head and grows to a length of about 75 centimeters (30 inches).","The sand viper is similar in habits to the horned viper, but it is slightly smaller, reaching about 35 centimeters (14 inches) in length in Israel. It is a fairly squat looking snake with a thin neck and tail but a thick body. It is a uniform pale sandy color.","The Palestinian viper is much larger than the other vipers of the Middle East. It grows to about 1.25 meters (4 feet) in length, and may be 100 millimeters (4 inches) thick. It is a beautifully marked snake, basically a light brown, with a dark brown zigzag stripe with a pale border down the middle of its back. It also has dark brown blotches with pale borders on each side of the zigzag stripe. Its head is striped.","This snake feeds on mice, toads, and frogs and is often found close to human dwellings. It lives under stones or in vegetation. As mentioned above, more people are bitten by this snake than any other. It is likely that this is the snake referred to by the Greek word <em>echidna</em>."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Vipers have the same basic significance in the Bible as other snakes, (see above) with one additional feature. Since the young are carried alive inside the female viper, which then gives birth to large numbers of well-developed young, all at the same time, the viper was associated with fertility. This was also their significance in the Egyptian and Canaanite religious systems."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Although vipers are found widely all over the world, not all languages distinguish them from other types of snake. As mentioned above, the carpet viper is found across Central Africa, from the west to east coasts, and into Central and South Asia. In these areas the name for this snake can be used in all the verses that refer to vipers. In southern Africa the Puff Adder <em>Bitis arietans</em> is probably the best equivalent.","In order to retain the relationship of the word <em>saraf</em> with the verb “to burn something,” translators often try to use expressions such as “vipers that burn [people]” or “fiery serpents\". This is only possible where the word used for “burn” means “to cause a wound with something hot.” One should not convey the idea of “a viper that sets people on fire” or “a viper that is burning.” Often it is better to use a phrase meaning simply “poisonous vipers\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:17</span>: Some commentaries have identified this snake as one of the sand vipers, since these conceal themselves so well that the horse may not see the snake and so be bitten on the heel. However, these snakes live in sand and would not be too likely to lie “by the path.” It is more likely to have been the carpet viper with its perfect camouflage.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 20:16</span>: The phrase “the tongue of a viper” reflects the Hebrew belief that a snake’s poison was produced by its tongue. This belief should be reflected in the translation if possible. The context clearly shows that profit made by evil means is likened to snake venom, so wording such as the following could be considered:","What he sucks in is cobra’s venom,","What he gains destroys him like the poisonous tongue of a viper.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 59:5</span>: This is a difficult verse, and commentators interpret it differently. A literal translation of the Hebrew is:","They hatch cobras’ eggs, they spin spiders’ webs,","The one who eats their eggs dies,","The one who/which is pressed, a viper is hatched/born.","The problem in interpretation centers around the subject of the first passive clause. Who or what is squashed, squeezed, or pressed? Many commentators take the subject to be the egg, but a few take it to mean the evil people (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>: “if one of them is pressed, it will hatch as a viper\"). If the first interpretation is followed, then the poem would read:","They hatch cobras’ eggs and spin spiders’ web.","Whoever eats their eggs dies,","And if one of their eggs is squashed a viper breaks out.","However, many have pointed out that it makes little sense to say a viper emerges from a cobra’s egg. The poetry would be making no new point at all. However, if the second interpretation is followed, the poem reads:","They hatch cobras’ eggs and spin spiders’ webs;","Whoever eats their eggs dies;","And if one of these people is squeezed, a viper emerges.","In other words, if you share the results of their deeds, you are destroyed, but if you oppose them, you are also in danger. The image in this latter rendering would be someone squashing a pregnant female viper whose eggs are due to be hatched. Living baby vipers would emerge. An ancient Arabic saying says “Crush the mother viper, and be bitten by her seven sons.” It is possible that both the Arabic saying and the Hebrew poem have common roots."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֶפְעֶה","transliteration":"’ef‘eh","references":["Job 20:16","Isa 30:6","Isa 59:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שָׂרָף","transliteration":"saraf","references":["Num 21:6","Num 21:8","Deut 8:15","Isa 14:29","Isa 30:6"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שְׁפִיפֹן","transliteration":"shefifon","references":["Gen 49:17"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἔχιδνα, ἔχις","transliteration":"echidna, echis","references":["Matt 3:7","Matt 12:34","Matt 23:33","Luke 3:7","Acts 28:3","Sir 39:30"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Job 20:16","Isa 30:6","Isa 59:5","Num 21:6","Num 21:8","Deut 8:15","Isa 14:29","Gen 49:17","Matt 3:7","Matt 12:34","Matt 23:33","Luke 3:7","Acts 28:3","Sir 39:30"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"5","book":"fauna","title":"Fish, frogs, and mollusks","depth":0,"indexItems":[{"target":"FAUNA:5.1","label":"5.1 Fish","text":"5.1 Fish"},{"target":"FAUNA:5.2","label":"5.2 Frog","text":"5.2 Frog"},{"target":"FAUNA:5.3","label":"5.3 Onycha","text":"5.3 Onycha"},{"target":"FAUNA:5.4","label":"5.4 Snail","text":"5.4 Snail"}],"sections":[],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"5.1","book":"fauna","title":"Fish","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דָּג, דָּגָה","transliteration":"dag, dagah","references":["Gen 1:26","Gen 1:28","Gen 9:2","Exod 7:18","Exod 7:21","Num 11:5","Num 11:22","Deut 4:18","1 Kgs 5:13","2 Chr 33:14","Neh 3:3","Neh 12:39","Neh 13:16","Job 12:8","Job 40:31","Ps 8:9","Ps 105:29","Eccl 9:12","Isa 50:2","Ezek 29:4","Ezek 29:4","Ezek 29:5","Ezek 38:20","Ezek 47:9","Ezek 47:10","Ezek 47:10","Hos 4:3","Jonah 2:1","Jonah 2:1","Jonah 2:2","Jonah 2:11","Hab 1:14","Zeph 1:3","Zeph 1:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἐνάλιον","transliteration":"enalion","references":["Jas 3:7"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἔνυδρος","transliteration":"enudros","references":["Wis 19:10","Wis 19:19","PrMan 1:34"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἰχθύς","transliteration":"ichthus","references":["Matt 7:10","Matt 14:17","Matt 14:19","Matt 15:36","Matt 17:27","Mark 6:38","Mark 6:41","Mark 6:41","Mark 6:43","Luke 5:6","Luke 5:9","Luke 9:13","Luke 9:16","Luke 11:11","Luke 11:11","Luke 24:42","John 21:6","John 21:8","John 21:11","1 Cor 15:39"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἰχθύδιον","transliteration":"ichthudion","references":["Matt 15:34","Mark 8:7"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κῆτος","transliteration":"kētos","references":["Matt 12:40"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"νηκτός","transliteration":"nēktos","references":["Wis 19:19"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ὀψάριον","transliteration":"opsarion","references":["John 6:9","John 6:11","John 21:9","John 21:10","John 21:13"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"προσφάγιον","transliteration":"prosfagion","references":["John 21:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"piscis","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 5:7","3 Macc 6:47","3 Macc 16:12"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0224_fish_en\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0224_fish_en.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0224_fish_en\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Fish</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-537832/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0224_fish_en.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Fish that had both fins and scales were acceptable food for the people of Israel.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0226_fishes\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0226_fishes.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0226_fishes\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Fish — A collection of colorful fish</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-1868779/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0226_fishes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Although fish are mentioned frequently in the Bible, there is no direct reference to fishing in the Old Testament. This is probably due to two main factors: a) the Hebrews as nomadic shepherds probably did not eat fish regularly until their sojourn in Egypt; and b) they were afraid of the sea, and thus probably did not get involved in commercial fishing until late in their history. Nevertheless, in Egypt in particular, fish would have been a regular item of the diet. The Nile River was full of good-eating fish, such as Nile perch, tilapia, and giant catfish, although this latter fish would not have been eaten by the Hebrews as it does not have obvious scales.","However, there is ample reference to the fact that after the Exodus from Egypt the people of Israel did eat fish, and different types of fishnets, fishing spears, and hooks are also referred to. Archeological finds indicate that the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians bred fish in ponds, and it is possible that the Israelites did the same. Most of the commercial fishing was done by the Philistines and other Phoenician peoples. One of the Philistine goddesses, Atargatis, whose cult began in Syria, was a fish-goddess.","Fishing in Lake Galilee does not seem to have been a Jewish activity until the Maccabean period. Until this period it seems that the Jews fished in rivers and streams and perhaps kept fish in ponds, but they bought dried fish from coastal peoples.","The Hebrew words <em>dag</em> and <em>dagah</em> are general terms and do not refer to any particular species. Marine fish found in the eastern Mediterranean Sea are not abundant, due to the fact that the sea in this region is poor in nutrients. The only fish likely to be caught in any numbers in nets in this region are sardines and mullet. There are tropical reef fish in those few inshore places where the reefs are shallow, and some line fishing may have been done for these species.","The Greek word <em>ichthus</em> and the Latin <em>piscis</em> are likewise general words for fish. However, <em>ichthudion</em> (literally “little fish\") is probably a reference to the Lake or Holy Land Sardine (sometimes called Bleak) <em>Mirogrex terrae sanctae</em>, which is abundant in Lake Galilee and has been fished for centuries. This is a small freshwater sardine similar to the <em>kapenta</em> found in the great lakes of Africa. Tilapia are also abundant in Lake Galilee.","The word <em>enalion</em> includes fish in its meaning but refers to all sea creatures, including crustaceans and dolphins. The word <em>opsarion</em> refers to cooked fish or fish about to be cooked and eaten. In the context of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 21:5</span> <em>prosfagion</em> refers to fish for breakfast. The word <em>nēktos</em> literally means “swimmer” and may include other water creatures, such as frogs."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In most contexts a general word for fish can be used.

For <em>opsarion</em> “cooked fish” can be used.

Thus the pest referred to by the Hebrew <em>ken</em> is likely mosquitoes that bite humans, in this case the Malaria Mosquito <em>Anopheles</em>. This identification was supported by Hort, who pointed out that once the Egyptian frogs had all died, mosquitoes and flies were bound to multiply in unprecedented numbers.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0628_midges\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0628_midges.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0628_midges\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Midge — A swarm of midges</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-1837656/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0628_midges.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Mosquitoes are small flying insects that make a characteristic whining noise as they fly. They are found wherever there is stagnant water and vegetation. Some species are active in the daytime, and others at night. They lay eggs on the surface of pools and puddles or in damp vegetation. The eggs hatch as small worm-like creatures called nymphs, which have hair-like tails through which they breathe. Most species of nymph live in water, but they must rise to the surface to breathe. When they mature, they emerge from the water and wait for their new wings to dry before they fly off to feed. Females of many species feed on human or animal blood, and some species can transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0609_louse\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0609_louse.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0609_louse\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Louse — View from the top of a body louse (Pediculus humanus)</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Body_lice.jpg • Janice Harney Carr, Center for Disease Control, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0609_louse.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><strong>Louse</strong>: This tiny wingless insect belongs to a family with the scientific name <em>Siphunculata (Anoplura)</em>. They are generally tiny, whitish creatures that live on humans, animals, or birds and feed by sucking blood from the skin. The Human Body Louse <em>Pediculus humanus</em> is usually found on the head and hairy parts of the body. Lice crawl around, but they do not jump like fleas. They are extremely common in crowded conditions, because they pass easily from one person to another. They lay small eggs attached to the hairs of the unknowing host.","Lice breed in dirt, and since the water in the first plague had “turned to blood,” the Egyptians probably did not bathe for some time. Conditions were probably dirtier than usual. Lice are also the carriers of the killer disease typhus. However, as a counter argument to the suggestion that <em>ken</em> are lice, some scholars have pointed out that the biblical text indicates that the <em>kinim</em> attacked man and beast, and lice are not normally a serious threat to livestock, but only a nuisance.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translation “lice” has the support of the eminent zoological archaeologist F.S. Bodenheimer, as well as rabbinical tradition and ancient commentators such as Josephus.","<strong>Maggot</strong>: The maggots found in many tropical countries are the larvae of various species of fly. The fly lays its eggs in clothing or in wounds on the skin. The eggs quickly hatch out as minute worms that burrow into the surrounding flesh, on which they feed. As they grow larger they form lumps like boils under the skin. The mature larvae then emerge, leaving open sores. These maggots are thus associated with flies on the one hand and with boils on the other. It seems significant that two of the following three plagues in Egypt were in fact flies and boils. This logical possibility is the main support for the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering. See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:6.13\">6.13 Worm, maggot</a>.","<strong>Ticks</strong> are small eight-legged creatures belonging to a class called <em>Arachnida</em>, which also includes spiders and scorpions. However, ticks are much smaller than the other members of the class and do not look like spiders or scorpions. They attach themselves very firmly to the skin of a person, animal, reptile, or bird and begin to suck blood (compare the meaning “attached firmly” which some scholars suggest as the root from which <em>ken</em> is derived). The females become so bloated that they swell to almost one hundred times their original size and then drop off and lay many eggs in the soil. When these eggs hatch, hundreds of baby ticks emerge and settle into the dust or attach themselves to grass stems. They are able to exist like this for many months, just waiting for a suitable person, animal, or bird to pass by. Once they are able to get onto the creature they were waiting for, they crawl around until they sense a blood vessel close to the surface. Then they bite into the skin and begin to feed. The places where they have begun to feed become very itchy and may turn into sores.","Ticks are a common pest in Egypt and many other subtropical and tropical countries. They carry diseases that can be dangerous to man, such as tropical tick fever (also known as relapsing fever), or dangerous to animals, such as Texas cattle fever and distemper. No English translation has yet adopted this interpretation, which is just as plausible as that of the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>.

The hornets are a primary pest to honey bees, attacking bee colonies to obtain honey and animal proteins.

The lower portion of these legs has a row of spikes that are used both for making sounds and as a means of defense. The front wings are narrow, straight, and stiff. When not being used to fly, they function as a cover for thin, membrane-like hind wings, which are much larger and colored, and which are folded together like a Chinese fan. When the locust or grasshopper flies, it hops into the air spreading out its wings as it does so. It flies with a slight clattering sound, made by the stiff front wings striking each other.","Locusts differ from grasshoppers mainly in that they form swarms at certain periods and migrate to new areas, which they colonize. At other times they live either solitary or in small groups. Their reproduction rate varies with the climatic conditions. Eggs are laid in the soil in small packets, and hatching is related to the degree of humidity. In dry periods only a few hatch, but in periods of good rainfall they suddenly hatch out in exceptionally large numbers.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0607_locusts\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0607_locusts.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0607_locusts\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Locust — Locusts eating leaves</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-1279546/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0607_locusts.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Unlike most other insects, locusts do not go through stages in which they exist as larvae or caterpillars. They emerge from the eggs as nymphs, which are simply tiny wingless locusts with undeveloped hopper legs. The nymphs, which can only crawl around, feed on green vegetation, consuming many times their own body weight each day. As they grow bigger and develop, they shed their skins. Their hopping legs develop before their wings, so that they pass through a stage when they can hop but not fly. At this stage, when they are referred to as “hoppers\", they exist in less dense masses than as nymphs, having spread out a little, but since they are now eating even more than before, they can still cause considerable damage to crops. Once they develop into adults they can both hop and fly. If the climatic conditions are right and exceptionally large numbers have developed to this stage, they completely devastate the vegetation where they have been developing. When this happens they begin to congregate in preparation for swarming. In other words they come together and migrate as a group to greener pastures, flying together in large swarms. At this congregating stage, during the migration and immediately after it, they present a major threat to crops and other vegetation, on which they feed unceasingly.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0608_locust_swarm\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0608_locust_swarm.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0608_locust_swarm\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Locust — Swarm of locusts near Satrokala, Madagascar</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Swarm_of_Locusts.JPG • © Iwoelbern, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0608_locust_swarm.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>A locust swarm may consist of billions of locusts. G.S. Cansdale quotes a report of a single swarm in 1889 that was estimated to cover 5,500 square kilometers (about 2,000 square miles). Certainly even in recent times swarms have been known large enough to blot out the sun like a large black cloud. The clattering of wings as the locusts approach is a sound hard to forget. Where the swarm lands, even temporarily, every green bush or clump of grass in sight is attacked by the locusts, and the sound of them munching on the leaves is clearly audible, sometimes for hours. Afterwards, hardly a single green leaf or blade of grass can be seen, and many bushes even have the bark eaten off, leaving them bare.","Against such enormous numbers ancient peoples felt absolutely helpless. There was no way they could stop the destruction. The lighting of grass fires helped only in a very small way. Ironically it is when locusts swarm like this that they can be easily caught in large numbers for eating. They are often caught in blankets, fishing nets, and baskets. The lower part of the hopping legs is snapped off, and they are cooked by toasting, grilling, frying, or broiling. In some places they are also eaten raw. When toasted and salted they taste a little like salted peanuts.","Some commentators have pointed out that the plague of locusts in Egypt probably provided the Israelites with food in the Arabian and Sinai deserts, since this is the usual migration route of locusts in that part of the world.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0606_locust\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0606_locust.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0606_locust\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Locust — Locust (Locusta migratoria) in its gregarious phase</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Locusta_migratoria_(gregarious_phase)_(5012171245).jpg • © Gilles San Martin from Namur, Belgium, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0606_locust.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Following is a summary of the development cycle of the major locust species: Nymphs, which can only crawl, develop to a hopping stage; the hoppers develop wings and become adult locusts; if climatic conditions are right, these adults gather into swarms and migrate to new locations; the females lay eggs, and the whole cycle is repeated. There are thus four discernible phases: nymphs, hoppers, resident adults, and swarming or migrating adults. It is possible that <em>chasil</em> refers to the crawling nymph, <em>yeleq</em> to the juvenile hopper, <em>’arbeh</em> to the resident adult, and <em>gazam</em> to the swarming adult. However, this is far from proven, as the words seem to be used almost interchangeably when referring to locust plagues.","<strong>Crickets and katydids</strong>: Crickets are a wingless, nocturnal relative of the locusts and grasshoppers. They are usually black or brown, with shorter rounder bodies, and they shelter during the day under rocks or logs, or, in the case of the so-called mole crickets, in holes that they dig. At night they make characteristic high-pitched chirping sounds, which carry a surprisingly long way. Each species makes a slightly different sound. Like locusts and grasshoppers they feed on vegetation, usually leaves.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0564_katydid\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0564_katydid.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0564_katydid\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Katydid — Leaf katydid</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leaf_Katydid_(Tettigoniidae)_(13908990358).jpg • © Bernard DUPONT, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0564_katydid.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>Katydids are similar to crickets but are usually green and have wings.

In these areas it should be easy to find a local word. However, in some countries with high rainfall this and other species of locust do not swarm in the same way that they do in the Middle East and the drier parts of Africa. In these countries it may be necessary in some contexts to use a phrase such as “swarms of locusts” rather than simply “locusts\". In areas where locusts are not known, a phrase like “large/giant grasshopper” can usually be substituted.","The Hebrew words <em>gev, gov</em> and <em>govay</em> are related to a verb meaning “to swarm” or “to gather together\", and thus the reference is almost certainly to the locust.","The word <em>tselatsal</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 28:42; Isa 18:1</span>) represents the sound of insects’ wings, and the reference is most likely to the sound made by a swarm of locusts. The English versions that have “whirring” or “buzzing” make some attempt at reflecting this, but “buzzing” is inadequate as a description of the sound such a swarm makes. “Clattering\", “chirping\", “whirring\", or “fluttering” comes closest in English to representing the sound represented by the Hebrew word.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> are alone in interpreting this word to refer to the “mole cricket\", an insect that at worst creates a minor nuisance, not a plague of the proportions of a locust swarm. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 18:1</span> both of these versions follow the Septuagint rather than the Masoretic Text, and translate “sailing ships\".","Translations that represent a) locust swarms and b) the sound such swarms make are recommended. In English this would be something like “whirring locust swarms” in both the Deuteronomy and Isaiah passages. In many Bantu languages in Africa, and in other languages where ideophones occur which express the sound of thousands of whirring wings, such ideophones are a good equivalent. Elsewhere a noun phrase, modified by an adverbial expression similar to the English, can be used.","In most contexts the word <em>chagav</em> seems to mean “grasshopper\", the exception being <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 7:13</span>, where the reference is to locusts. In the two passages where the grasshopper symbolizes something small and insignificant (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 13:33</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:22</span>), it may not be possible to capture the right inference by translating literally. In such cases the translator is free to use some other insect that is symbolic of small size and insignificance in the local culture, such as “ant\", “louse\", “flea\", and others. In cases where no insect name carries this symbolism, the name of an animal with the correct connotations can be used; for example, “mouse” or “squirrel\".","In verses where only one Hebrew word for “locust” occurs, there is little problem, and the word for “grasshopper” or “locust” in the local language can be used. The following notes refer to cases where more than one of these words occur:","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:22</span>: This text contains four clean insects. The two Hebrew words <em>sol‘am</em> and <em>chargol</em> occur only here, so it is very difficult to be precise about their meaning. The suggestions, therefore, have to be very tentative.","From the general rule given in this verse about the characteristics of clean insects, we can deduce that all four of the insects have specialized legs for hopping. This would suggest that locusts (<em>’arbeh</em>), grasshoppers (<em>chagav</em>), and crickets (probably <em>chargol</em>) would be included in the list, as various species of these three insects are commonly eaten in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Since a fourth name occurs in the list, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> translates <em>sol‘am</em> as “katydid\", while <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translates <em>chargol</em> as “katydids” and <em>sol‘am</em> as “grasshoppers\". The katydid is a nocturnal hopping insect similar to a grasshopper in many respects, but usually with green leaf-shaped wings. However, katydids are usually solitary creatures, and not very easy to collect, and thus they are not commonly a food source. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and possibly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> take <em>sol‘am</em> to be a type of locust, so that their lists contain two types of locust, plus grasshoppers and crickets.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> opt rather for four different kinds of locust, which they refer to as the “great locust” (<em>’arbeh</em>), the “long-headed locust” (<em>sol‘am</em>), the “green locust” (<em>chargol</em>), and the “desert locust” (<em>chagav</em>). These identifications are based on the supposed etymology of the words, that is, the ancient Semitic roots from which the Hebrew words are derived. However, etymology is a very dubious basis for ascribing meaning to words, and these particular derivations have little support in the scholarly world. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translates <em>chagav</em> as “cricket\".","All that can be said with certainty about the list of clean insects is that it most probably contains locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets. It is probably safest to translate the list as “all kinds of locusts, all kinds of grasshoppers, and all kinds of crickets,” and add this footnote: “In Hebrew there are four insects in the list. Some scholars suggest that these are four different types of locust.\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 8:37; 2 Chr 6:28</span>: The Hebrew in these verses has both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>chasil</em> in a list of calamities. The reference is probably to adult and juvenile locusts, so translations such as “locusts and grasshoppers\", “large and small locusts” and “adult locusts and their children” are common.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 78:46</span>: In Hebrew this verse again contains both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>chasil</em>, and the reference is again probably to adult and juvenile locusts. The following can therefore serve as a model:","He gave their [newly sprouting] fields to the grasshoppers [young locusts/small locusts]","And their [mature] crops to the locusts [adult locusts/large locusts].","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 105:34</span>: This verse contains both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>yeleq</em> with similar meaning to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 78:46</span>:","He spoke, and locusts came,","young locusts/grasshoppers beyond number.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 33:4</span>: In this verse the two words for locust are <em>chasil</em> and <em>gev</em>, and the reference, as above, seems to be to juvenile and adult locusts:","Their belongings are plundered as if they were being stripped by grasshoppers [young locusts],","And people swarm over their goods like (adult) locusts.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 1:4; Joel 2:25</span>: In each of these verses there are no less than four different words for locust: <em>gazam</em>, <em>’arbeh</em>, <em>yeleq</em>, and <em>chasil</em>. Most commentators accept that this refers to locusts in four different stages of development. These would presumably be the swarming adult locust, the resident adult locust, the wingless hopper, and the crawling nymph. However, as can be seen above, although <em>yeleq</em> and <em>chasil</em> are both used for juvenile locusts, it is impossible to say which refers to the nymph and which to the hopper.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> rendering “what one swarm of locusts left, the next swarm devoured” conveys the general idea, but is technically inaccurate in that not all the Hebrew words necessarily refer to swarming locusts. A more precise translation would be:","What the swarming locusts left, the resident locusts ate;","What the resident locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate;","And what the young hopping locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 3:15; Nah 3:16; Nah 3:17</span>: In the Hebrew poetry of this passage three words for locust are used in parallelisms: <em>’arbeh, yeleq</em> and <em>gov</em>. Regardless of the precise meaning of the words for the different types of officials, it is clear that the three words for locust are synonymous. They are a metaphor for a) large numbers, b) destructiveness, and c) transients (temporary visitors). In many languages there will not be more than one word for locust, if that.

This suggestion has been widely accepted and included in various English versions in footnotes. The hippopotamus was certainly well-known in Egypt and possibly in parts of Mesopotamia. However, the description in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 40:15–Job 40:20</span> does not fit the hippopotamus at many points:","For one thing the strength and the powerful muscles of Behemoth mentioned in could hardly be associated with the hippopotamus, which spends most of its time quietly grazing or just resting in the water. (The jaws of a hippo are enormously strong, and bull hippos are dangerous animals, but overall, even a careful observer would not be struck with awe at its muscles and strength.)","Secondly, the very small stubby tail of the hippopotamus cannot be raised and is only used for scattering dung as the hippo defecates. It could hardly be likened to a cedar as <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 40:17</span> says.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0296_hippo\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0296_hippo.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0296_hippo\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"image-caption-text\">Hippopotamus — Birds find parasites to eat on the back of the hippo</span><span class=\"image-attribution\">https://pixabay.com/images/id-79296/ • CC0, Pixabay</span><a class=\"image-source-link\" href=\"https://d18g7qbkwqqlmo.cloudfront.net/0x0/WEB/WEB-0296_hippo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>And finally, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 40:20</span> Behemoth is said to be fed by the grass of the mountains, but hippos normally feed on riverbanks, or in the vicinity of flood plains and river valleys, and are rarely, if ever, found in hills, since their extremely short legs and great weight make it difficult for them to step over rocks or climb steep slopes.

Both the African Elephant <em>Loxodonta Africana</em>, which lived in the Nile valley in southern Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and the Indian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, which lived in northern Mesopotamia, were known in Old Testament times. The description of Behemoth fits the elephant better than the hippopotamus. Its great strength is very evident. When running, elephants also hold their tails out straight. However, the Hebrew word translated as “tail” could also refer to the trunk. The mention of “lying down under the thorn trees, in the cover of the reeds in the marsh” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 40:21</span>) could refer to the well-known habit elephants have of taking dust baths and wallowing in mudholes and rivers.","It has sometimes been argued that the references to frequenting rivers and eating grass cannot apply to elephants.

See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.","<strong>parallel (parallelism)</strong> generally refers to some similarity in the content and/or form of two parts of a construction; for example, “The man was blind; he could not see.” The structures that correspond to each other in the two statements are said to be parallel.","<strong>receptor</strong> is the person(s) receiving a message. The receptor language is the language into which a translation is made. For example, in a translation from Hebrew into German, Hebrew is the source language and German is the receptor language.","<strong>render</strong> means to translate or express in a language different from the original. <strong>rendering</strong> is the manner in which a specific passage is translated from one language to another.","<strong>restructure</strong> is to separate and rearrange the various components of a sentence or other unit of discourse in the translation process.","<strong>Semitic</strong> refers to a family of languages that includes <strong>Hebrew</strong>, <strong>Aramaic</strong>, and Arabic. <strong>Greek</strong> belongs to quite another language family, with a distinct cultural background. In view of the Jewish ancestry and training of the writers of the New Testament, it is not surprising that many Semitic idioms and thought patterns (called Semitisms or Hebraisms) appear in the Greek writings of the New Testament.","<strong>Septuagint</strong> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LXX</abbr>.","<strong>simile</strong> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object by comparing it to another, using “like,” “as,” or some other word to mark or signal the comparison; for example, “She runs like a deer” and “He is as straight as an arrow.” Similes are less subtle than <strong>metaphors</strong> in that metaphors do not mark the comparison with words such as “like” or “as.” See <strong>metaphor</strong>.","<strong>species</strong> is the major subdivision of a <strong>genus</strong> or subgenus, and is regarded as the basic category of biological classification. A species is composed of related individuals that resemble one another, and are able to breed among themselves, but are not able to breed with members of another species. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.","<strong>subfamily</strong> is a category of related <strong>genera</strong> within a <strong>family</strong>. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.","<strong>subspecies</strong> is a subdivision of a <strong>species</strong>, especially a geographical or ecological subdivision. See the chart of Animal Classification Ranks on page 2.","<strong>symbol</strong> is a form, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, which is arbitrarily and conventionally associated with a particular meaning. For example, the word “cross” is a linguistic symbol, referring to a particular object. Similarly, within the Christian tradition, the cross as an object is a symbol for the death of Jesus.","<strong>synonyms</strong> are words that are different in form but similar in meaning, such as “boy” and “lad.” Expressions that have essentially the same meaning are said to be <strong>synonymous</strong>.","<strong>Syriac</strong> is the name of a <strong>Semitic</strong> language, a part of the <strong>Aramaic</strong> family, used in Western Asia, into which the Bible was translated at a very early date (the <strong>Syriac version</strong>).","<strong>Targum</strong> is an Aramaic translation or paraphrase of a section of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.","<strong>trade language</strong> refers to a language used as a means of communication when conducting trade and business between peoples of different languages.","<strong>transliteration</strong> is the representation in the receptor language of the approximate sounds or letters of words occurring in the source language, rather than translating their meaning; for example, “Amen” from the Hebrew, or the title “Christ” from the Greek.","<strong>vernacular</strong> refers to the ordinary language used in daily speech by any group of people; it is in contrast with a learned or literary language.","<strong>versions</strong> are translations. The ancient, or early, versions are translations of the Bible, or of portions of the Bible, made in early times; for example, the Greek Septuagint, the ancient Syriac, or the Ethiopic versions."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"9","book":"fauna","title":"Selected Bibliography","depth":0,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Texts</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em>. 1967/77; 5th corrected printing, 1997.
