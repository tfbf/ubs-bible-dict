This is to be expected, since the people of Israel lived in an environment that had not been modified to any great extent by man, and the hunters among them, hunting with their simple weapons, had not reduced animal populations significantly. A certain amount of woodland was cut down for human use or burnt to create grazing land, but this would not have been very extensive. For century after century the environment would have been left virtually in its natural state.","Even in their major cities the Hebrew people were surrounded by birds, lizards, and insects, and they did not need to venture very far afield before they were among wild animals. There were herds of gazelles and antelope grazing and browsing freely in the open plains, with deer and wild pigs in the more wooded areas. In the rockier mountain areas there were ibexes and wild mountain sheep. These city dwellers also had livestock of their own, feeding in the pastures around the city, cared for by family members or hired herdsmen. They would thus all have been very familiar with the habits and behavior of both the domestic and the wild creatures.","The land in those days had, and still has, a large number of bird species, some of which were resident, while others were migrants. Many species of bird from Central Asia and Europe fly to Africa at the beginning of the northern winter. In order to avoid flying long distances over the Mediterranean Sea or the Indian Ocean, they take a land route that passes over Israel. Thus there are literally millions of birds that pass over every year, going south between late September and early November, and returning north in March and April. There are probably more migrating birds passing over Israel than any other country on earth, since this is the only place in the world where three continents meet. Many of them stay for a few weeks in Israel, regaining their strength before they move on again. As a result they are well known to the local people. This would have been true also in biblical times."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Identifying the Biblical Animals and Birds</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Translating the Hebrew and Greek names of the animals and birds of the Bible is very difficult. There is doubt about the meaning of many of the animal names. Even greater doubt exists about the meaning of most bird names, as can be seen from a comparison of Bible translations. It is rare indeed that they will agree or that the same bird name will be translated the same way each time.","In the light of this problem, the author of this Handbook has tried to apply a uniform methodology for each section of the book. First, there has been a study of archaeological and other evidence, and a careful attempt has been made to ascertain which animals, birds, and other creatures are most likely to have been found in Egypt and the land of Israel in biblical times. Then, on the basis of the biblical contexts in which the creature’s name occurs, and in the light of what is known about the meaning of the verb root from which the name is derived, an attempt has been made to match the most likely creature with the given contexts.","The results of this method should not be taken as the last word on the subject but should be seen as either a) support for one or more existing translations, or b) yet another plausible option from which to choose.","In addition to the above problems, a further problem is that the English names for some of the birds differ from place to place. For example, the eagle known in books published in Britain, Israel, and East Africa as the short-toed eagle is known as the black-breasted snake-eagle in books published in the U.S.A. and southern Africa. For this reason the scientific names are also given along with the popular names. Occasionally there are even alternate scientific names, and in these cases both are given. The scientific names are used universally in bird books, regardless of the language of publication.","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table-classification_en\">[Image: fauna-table-classification_en]</span>Zoologists use a universally accepted system of classifying animals. This handbook makes frequent use of terms in this classification system. In some places, where scientific precision is not a factor, other terms such as “types” or “varieties” may appear. The following is a table of major classification categories, or ranks, in descending order of size. Ranks appearing in BOLD TYPEFACE are defined in the glossary."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Translating the Words for the Biblical Creatures</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Translators are advised to obtain the best available field guides for the animals and birds of their area; from this they should try to find the nearest local equivalents. Even where these books are in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or German, the pictures, the descriptions, and the scientific names will help to identify the animals or birds, and then the vernacular name, if any, can be found. In some field guides in Africa, such as the excellent <em>Roberts’ Birds of Southern Africa</em>, an attempt has been made to provide some of the names in local languages. These vernacular names should be carefully checked on the basis of the pictures and descriptions, and the translators should find out what most people in the language community call the birds. It is likely that there are often regional differences in the vocabulary for birds.","Finding a local equivalent will in many cases be difficult for translators in the Americas, the Far East, and Australasia, especially for the birds, since most of the biblical birds are either found only in the lands of the Bible, or they migrate between Europe or Central Asia and Africa but are not found further afield. The translator will always have the following options:","1. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the same creature.","2. Translate the biblical word with the local word for the most similar local creature, paying attention to the special symbolic importance the biblical or local animal may have.","3. Translate the word for a specific animal with a more generic word. Thus, for instance, where bears are not known, an expression like “a big fierce animal” with a footnote could substitute in some contexts.","4. Translate the biblical word with a word borrowed from a well-known trade or international language that refers to the biblical creature, and include a description of the creature in a glossary or short dictionary at the end of your Bible.","Of these options the first one is the best solution, but it will only be possible, of course, where the animal mentioned in the Bible is well known locally. Even in these cases, however, the translator needs to be careful, especially where the animal is referred to in the Bible in a figurative expression or metaphor. The significance in the biblical culture may be very different from its significance in the local culture. As an example, to the Hebrew writers the hyena signified death, ruin, and the desolation that results from being utterly defeated in war. But in some African cultures the hyena is associated with witches. In these cultures to say “Your land will become the dwelling place of hyenas” implies that your land will be taken over by witches. This is not the implication intended by a Hebrew writer using exactly the same expression.","Similarly, in many parts of Asia a dragon symbolizes good fortune and prosperity, but in the Bible it symbolizes evil and wickedness. In cases like these the translator will need to add a footnote to clarify the intended implication for the reader.","The second option is also often a good solution, provided that the local animal and the biblical animal share enough important similarities. Again the implications of using the substitute in figurative expressions should be carefully checked. It is important to avoid giving the wrong impression about the type of climate and landscape that existed in Israel in the choice of a local substitute. For instance, if “water buffalo” is substituted for “wild ox,” and “tiger” is substituted for “lion,” the reader automatically pictures Israel as a land of monsoon rain forest. It may be necessary in such cases to add a footnote indicating that the original text actually refers to different animals similar to those mentioned in the translation.","If the translator opts to use a generic expression where the original refers to a specific animal or bird (option 3), care should again be taken to recreate the correct implications in cases where the animal is referred to in a figurative expression. This can often be done by adding an adjective or a descriptive phrase. For instance, where jackals are not known but dogs are, “wild dog” may be the best local equivalent, but it would not carry the right implication in many contexts. However, a phrase like “wild dog of doom” may recreate the intended implication. Such “additions” are entirely justified, since the implication is clearly intended in the original text.","In the case where borrowed words are used in the translation (option 4), the word should always be explained in a glossary at the end of the Bible. Care should also be taken to spell the borrowed word in a way that readers will be able to pronounce easily. If readers stumble and hesitate when reading these borrowed words, this is an indication that the transliteration needs improving at this point."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Special Features of this Handbook</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In spite of the importance of animals in the Bible, it is very confusing for many translators and Bible students to compare various Bible translations and discover that when it comes to the names of animals and birds, the versions hardly ever agree. For example, if the list of unclean birds in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:13–Lev 11:19</span> is compared in different versions, it can be seen that what the Revised Standard Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) calls an “ibis” the New English Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>) calls a “screech owl,” the Jerusalem Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>) a “cormorant,” and the New International Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) a “great owl.” In fact there are no two English versions in which the list is identical.","This all stems from the fact that many of the ancient Hebrew words for animals, birds, insects, and reptiles cannot be associated with a particular creature with any certainty. At best the commentators and translators can only make their best, educated guesses.","Even the scholars face problems. Many of them are experts in Hebrew and Greek, or in other ancient languages of the Middle East, but they have very little expertise when it comes to the study of animals, birds, and so forth. As a result, in some versions the text is made to refer to animals that never existed in Bible lands. Alternatively they may know all about the animals and birds of the region but have only a slight knowledge of biblical Hebrew and Greek.","This Handbook is designed to provide the Bible student with a better foundation on which to base interpretations of these problematic words. The zoological, linguistic, and archaeological facts have been studied in great detail (including all of the biblical contexts in which the words occur). The results of this study are summarized here, with an attempt to guide the student or translator to what we consider to be the most probable interpretation. Sometimes this involves not only the interpretation of a word for a particular animal, but also the interpretation of statements that are made about that animal in the Bible.","The book is divided into the following chapters:"]},{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Within each chapter the animals are arranged in alphabetical order according to their names. Separate treatment is given to each of the creatures, even to those mentioned only once. To make things as useful as possible for the student/translator, each entry is arranged identically. The heading of the entry is based on the English name or names for the creature that is suggested by the author. This may not be the same name that appears in the English Bible version that the student or translator is using. In cases where there does not seem to be an entry on the animal you wish to study, go to the index l of Animals, and you will find it listed there. Alternatively, you can turn to the index of Scripture References. If you then go to the page number given in the index, you will find some discussion about the creature you are looking for.","As a general rule, there is at least one Bible version and a group of scholars that support the author’s recommended translation, but in one or two cases the only support for the recommendation comes from some scholars but not from any current version of the English Bible. In all cases this is clearly indicated in the text.","We hope that this Handbook will prove to be both helpful and interesting to all who read it. At times it has been necessary to use language that is fairly technical, but an attempt has been made to include in parentheses the more common, but slightly less precise, expressions."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"1","book":"fauna","title":"Animals, general","depth":0,"indexItems":[{"target":"FAUNA:1.1","label":"1.1 Domestic animals, cattle, livestock, animal, living being","text":"1.1 Domestic animals, cattle, livestock, animal, living being"},{"target":"FAUNA:1.2","label":"1.2 Animals that are ridden or made to carry loads","text":"1.2 Animals that are ridden or made to carry loads"},{"target":"FAUNA:1.3","label":"1.3 Wild or dangerous animals","text":"1.3 Wild or dangerous animals"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"A number of words in the Bible indicate “animals” or “creatures” in a general way without specifying a particular species.

this type would have been familiar to the people of the period.

The bubal hartebeest is both red and remarkably like a horned donkey. It is also known as the red hartebeest. The word “hartebeest” is a word borrowed from Dutch and literally means “deer-cow\".","Interestingly, the Septuagint translates <em>yachmur</em> as <em>bubalos</em> “water buffalo\", which was an animal well known to the Israelites. Water buffalo were domesticated in Babylonia and Syria and were found in the marshes of northern Israel around Lake Huleh. However this translation has no support among modern scholars.

They also have a very efficient digestive system and can extract the maximum amount of nutrition from apparently dry vegetation. This adaptation to harsh environments means that camels can make long journeys through dry areas which would be beyond the abilities of other types of pack animal such as donkeys. Camels were used for riding and for carrying heavy loads. They were also used to pull carts.","In winter the fur of camels thickens and grows longer and then when summer comes they shed their winter fur in large wads. These wads of camel hair are collected and twisted into cords and ropes or spun into thread which is then used for weaving coarse cloth. This cloth was usually used for making tents but it was sometimes used for making outer robes.","Camels’ milk was used as food and drink but their meat was considered unclean by the Israelites."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In spite of the fact that camels were considered to be unclean for food they were a symbol of wealth and commerce.

However, in some languages descriptive names have been invented. In some South American languages names meaning “hump-backed llama” or “big alpaca with a hump” have been used. Elsewhere expressions such as “hump-backed horse” have been used. A fuller description should usually be included in a glossary or word list.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 32:15</span>: Here the reference is to female camels that are providing milk, and the expression is often translated as “thirty camels for milking\", or “thirty mother camels giving milk\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span>: Although the word <em>beker</em> is probably related to the Hebrew root <em>B-K-R</em> meaning “early” or “the first\", the usage in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span> seems not to place any special emphasis on the youth of the camels, but perhaps on their superior quality. The word is used to provide a qualifying synonym (a word having basically the same meaning) for “camel” in order to complete a poetic couplet. The English word “dromedary” has this same function in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>.","In languages that have two words for camel, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 60:6</span> the usual word for camel can be used in the first part of the couplet and the lesser known word can be used for <em>beker</em> in the parallel line of the poem. However, in languages with only one word for camel, or in languages in which a borrowed or made-up word is used, it is better to use the usual word for camel in the first line of the couplet and then use a suitable qualifying expression to complete the couplet; for example:","Camel caravans will cover the land,","The best camels from Midian and Ephah;","And from Sheba . . . .","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 2:23</span> the context clearly indicates that <em>bikrah</em> refers to a female camel ready for mating, that is, “in heat\". The word translated “wild” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> is better translated “berserk” (compare “frantic” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>). The full expression can be translated as “You have gone berserk like a female camel in heat.\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 66:20</span>: The word <em>kirkaroth</em> (singular, <em>kirkarah</em>), used only once in the Bible, seems to refer to camels used for riding rather than for carrying merchandise. In the context, which depicts people coming from distant foreign lands, the reference may be to Bactrian camels from Central Asia. In most languages the normal word for camel can be used in this verse. In languages that have different markers for pack animals and animals for riding, the word for camel in this verse can be marked as “camel for riding\". Where Bactrian camels are known, the word for this type of camel can be used here.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 19:24; Matt 23:24; Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25</span>: In these passages the large size of the camel is contrasted with a small eye of a needle in the one case, and with a small mosquito in the other. In some languages where camels are not well known, translators have used the name of a better known large animal, such as “bull\", “horse\", or “elephant\", in order to retain the impact of Jesus’ words for the local readers. In such cases it is necessary to use a footnote to the effect that the Greek text has “camel\". Translators should avoid using the names of animals that were not known to the original audience, such as “moose” or “kangaroo\", or words that would have had a negative connotation, such as “big pig\"."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בֵּכֶר, בִּכְרָה","transliteration":"beker, bikrah","references":["Isa 60:6","Jer 2:23"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"גָּמָל","transliteration":"gamal","references":["Gen 12:16","Gen 24:10","Gen 24:10","Gen 24:11","Gen 24:14","Gen 24:19","Gen 24:20","Gen 24:22","Gen 24:30","Gen 24:31","Gen 24:32","Gen 24:32","Gen 24:35","Gen 24:44","Gen 24:46","Gen 24:46","Gen 24:61","Gen 24:63","Gen 24:64","Gen 30:43","Gen 31:17","Gen 31:34","Gen 32:8","Gen 32:16","Gen 37:25","Exod 9:3","Lev 11:4","Deut 14:7","Judg 6:5","Judg 7:12","Judg 8:21","Judg 8:26","1 Sam 15:3","1 Sam 27:9","1 Sam 30:17","1 Kgs 10:2","2 Kgs 8:9","1 Chr 5:21","1 Chr 12:41","1 Chr 27:30","2 Chr 9:1","2 Chr 14:14","Ezra 2:67","Neh 7:68","Job 1:3","Job 1:17","Job 42:12","Isa 21:7","Isa 30:6","Isa 60:6","Jer 49:29","Jer 49:32","Ezek 25:5","Zech 14:15"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"כִּרְכָּרָה","transliteration":"kirkarah","references":["Isa 66:20"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κάμηλος","transliteration":"kamēlos","references":["Matt 3:4","Matt 19:24","Matt 23:24","Mark 1:6","Mark 10:25","Luke 18:25","Tob 9:2","Jdt 2:17","Ps 151 5:42"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"camelus","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 15:36"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Isa 60:6","Jer 2:23","Gen 12:16","Gen 24:10","Gen 24:11","Gen 24:14","Gen 24:19","Gen 24:20","Gen 24:22","Gen 24:30","Gen 24:31","Gen 24:32","Gen 24:35","Gen 24:44","Gen 24:46","Gen 24:61","Gen 24:63","Gen 24:64","Gen 30:43","Gen 31:17","Gen 31:34","Gen 32:8","Gen 32:16","Gen 37:25","Exod 9:3","Lev 11:4","Deut 14:7","Judg 6:5","Judg 7:12","Judg 8:21","Judg 8:26","1 Sam 15:3","1 Sam 27:9","1 Sam 30:17","1 Kgs 10:2","2 Kgs 8:9","1 Chr 5:21","1 Chr 12:41","1 Chr 27:30","2 Chr 9:1","2 Chr 14:14","Ezra 2:67","Neh 7:68","Job 1:3","Job 1:17","Job 42:12","Isa 21:7","Isa 30:6","Jer 49:29","Jer 49:32","Ezek 25:5","Zech 14:15","Isa 66:20","Matt 3:4","Matt 19:24","Matt 23:24","Mark 1:6","Mark 10:25","Luke 18:25","Tob 9:2","Jdt 2:17","Ps 151 5:42","3 Macc 15:36"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.9","book":"fauna","title":"Cat","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"reference","heading":"Reference:\"","headingHtml":"Reference:\"","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Greek","lemma":"αἴλουρος","transliteration":"ailouros","references":["EpJer 1:21"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0117_cat\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0117_cat.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0117_cat\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Cats were first domesticated in Egypt or Ethiopia about 1600 or 1700 B.C. and in China about the same time. It seems likely that in Africa the African Wild Cat <em>felis lybica</em> in its search for mice and rats began to inhabit granaries and was finally coaxed into people’s homes by feeding it scraps of meat. These earliest domestic cats were kept not simply as pets but for the control of the rodents. In Egypt the goddess Basht was given the cat as her symbol and she is usually depicted as having a cat’s head. Cats were also mummified and buried with important people. Basht was the divinity believed to inhabit and govern the region east of the Nile which is where the Israelites lived from the time of Joseph to the time of the Exodus. These associations of the cat with Basht probably explain why there is no mention of cats in the protocanonical books of the Bible and the only time cats are mentioned in the deuterocanonical books is in relation to Babylonian temples.","In the centuries following the domestication of the cat the domestic Libyan cat was adopted by neighboring nations and soon domestic cats were found as far away as India. Wherever the domestic cat was kept it interbred with local wild cats resulting in the many variants now found. The cat referred to in the Letter of Jeremiah (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">EpJer 1:21</span>) may have been the African wild cat (which was found wild even far to the east of Babylonia) or another local wild cat such as the European Wild Cat <em>Felis sylvestris</em>. In ancient times wild cats were considered to be beneficial since they kept down the rat population and thus offered some protection for crops and granaries. As a result wild cats were probably common in towns and villages.

and breeding among the Hebrews are first mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 12:16</span>, when Abram is given cattle by the king of Egypt and brings them back to Canaan. From this time on cattle formed an important element in Hebrew life and culture, although ownership of cattle was limited to relatively wealthy people. The area of Gilead in particular, became known for the number and the quality of cattle there (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 32:1; Num 32:4; 1 Chr 5:9</span>).","<em>English terminology</em>","For the sake of readers who are not mother tongue speakers of English it seems best to clarify the rather bewildering variety of collective terms for cattle. Even mother tongue speakers sometimes have difficulties with these.","<strong>Cattle</strong>: This word in modern English is a plural form but there is no singular or countable form of the word. So when referring to a specific number of animals of this kind one has either to use expressions such as “five head of cattle” or to specify the gender of the animals in expressions such as “four cows and one bull.” In an earlier form of English the word meant “possessions” then it came to mean “livestock” and finally in modern English it is a more specific word referring collectively to any domestic cow-like animals whether they be cows, bulls, oxen, calves, bullocks, steers, or heifers.","<strong>Cows and Bulls</strong>: Although cows are strictly speaking adult female cattle the word in modern English is sometimes used to mean “cattle” without reference to gender especially when using numbers. Thus “400 cows” can mean “400 head of cattle.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> sometimes uses the word in this sense. The word for adult male cattle, “bulls\", is never used with this more general meaning.","<strong>Oxen</strong>: In modern English this word refers to bulls that have been castrated in order to make them more docile so that they can be used as work animals. The effects of castration were discovered very soon after cattle were first domesticated and although the Jews were forbidden to castrate animals they seem to have obtained such animals from gentile neighbors or ignored the prohibition.","A more archaic usage of the English “oxen” has the general meaning of “cattle\". This archaic usage is preserved in words such as “oxgoat\", “oxtail\", or “wild oxen\", where the gender of the animals is not a component of the meaning. It is this archaic general sense in which most English versions use the word especially when quantifying. Thus in these versions “400 oxen” means “400 head of cattle” not “400 castrated bulls.” This is the reason why we find reference to oxen being sacrificed even though there is a specific prohibition against sacrificing animals that have been castrated.","<strong>Steers</strong>: These are castrated bulls that are raised for slaughtering not for work.","<strong>Bullocks</strong>: This word generally means young bulls but in some dialects of English such as Australian it can also mean the same as “oxen” or “steers\", that is, castrated bulls.","<strong>Heifers</strong>: This is the word used for young cows that have not yet given birth to their first calf.","<strong>Calves</strong>: These are young cattle of either sex.","<em>Dairy products</em>","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0159_cows\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0159_cows.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0159_cows\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Cows, sheep and goats were all milked by the Israelites. However because of the climate in which they lived and the way in which milk was stored in goatskin bags the milk did not stay fresh very long. They probably drank sour milk as do most other nomadic herding societies. When sour milk is shaken lumps called “curds” separate from the rest of the milk which then becomes a thin and watery liquid called “whey\". The curds can be eaten as they are and this is what is often translated as “butter” in English versions. It is not, however, what is normally called butter in the modern world. The curds can also be packed together salted and dried in flat cakes. This is what is referred to as “cheese” in most English versions. It did not keep as well as modern cheese which has a rind or skin to keep it fresh."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["By the time Abram moved into Canaan, several breeds of cattle had already been developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt.

When used of animals it may refer to war-horses or to bulls. The context usually, but not always, gives the clue as to which sense is meant. The contexts in which bulls are meant unambiguously are <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 50:13; Ps 68:31</span>; and probably <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 50:11</span>, although in the latter verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translate the word as “stallions\". The parallelism is better retained by translating “grazing heifer in heat” and “bellowing bull” rather than “neighing stallion” in the second line.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:7</span> is an interesting case. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering “bison” can be discounted. For one thing to translate like this turns a prophecy of doom into a prophecy about a hunting expedition, which is highly unlikely; but perhaps even more serious, there is no evidence at all that the European bison, also known as the Wisent <em>Bison bonasus</em>, was ever found anywhere near as far south as Edom.","The poetry in this verse plays on the fact that <em>’abir</em> can refer to people as well as to bulls. The poem speaks of a sacrifice being prepared by Yahweh, and then, by using an ambiguous expression for the sacrificial animals, the inference is that people, not animals, are to be killed. This is reflected well in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> translations. The poetic verse means something like:","Like wild oxen, they themselves will fall dead,","Like sacrificial bulls (parim), their mighty men.","<em>’aluf, ’elef</em>: These words are probably related to the root <em>’a-l-f-</em>, to teach or train. Thus ’aluf/’elef indicates tame or domesticated animals. A general word for “cattle” is recommended.","<em>Behemah</em> usually means “animal\", “domestic animal\", or “livestock\". In the passages listed above, it should be translated “cattle\". See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:1\">1 Animals, general</a>.","<em>Baqar</em> is the most general word for “cattle\". In its widest usage it basically means “herds” and may include sheep and goats, but always includes cattle. Often it means only cattle and is used in contrast to sheep and goats. In some contexts, where <em>baqar</em> are referred to as having given birth, it is clear that only cows are meant.","In translating <em>baqar</em> translators should first determine whether the context refers to livestock in general, or to cattle specifically, and translate accordingly. Generally when an English translation has “herds” without specifying which animals are meant, the meaning of <em>baqar</em> is “livestock” or “domestic animals” in general. If the reference is to cattle, use a general word. In languages where there are many words for cattle, depending on gender, age, color, breed, and other things, the most all-inclusive word for cattle should be used, except when a specific context indicates otherwise, such as <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 22:19</span>, where bulls are obviously meant.","<em>Meri’</em> refers to a stall-fed animal, usually a calf, that is reserved for sacrifice. It is best translated “stall-fed calf\", “fattened calf\", or “choice calf.” The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> translation “buffalo\", comes from a comparison with similar words in other Semitic languages which might mean “buffalo,” but this is not widely accepted by commentators since similar words in related languages often have different meanings. For instance the English “deer” and the German “Tier” are related, but have different meanings (the German word means “animal\"). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 11:6</span> the Masoretic Text includes “and a fatted calf” but the Septuagint and the Vulgate follow a different text, and thus most modern versions do not include this phrase.","<em>‘egel</em> and <em>‘eglah</em> indicate male and female calves (heifers) respectively. These words are also used for the images of calves worshiped by the Canaanites. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> make this clear in the book of Hosea by translating the words as “calf-gods” and “calf-idols\". Most such contexts are self-evident, but <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 10:5</span> is one reference to calf-idols which most versions do not adequately identify. See, however, the New Century Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>) with the “calf-shaped idol\". <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders “idols” and adds a footnote: “The Hebrew text has ‘calves,’ referring to the idols made in the shape of calves.","<em>Par</em> refers specifically to young bulls reserved for sacrifice. Some commentators deduce that these are firstborn bulls; others believe that the bulls were especially fattened. This latter position is reflected in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> translation of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 6:25</span>. It is likely that both positions are correct. The age of the sacrificial bull varied from one year to three years and older, so the translation “calf” is a little misleading. <em>Par</em> is best translated by a phrase meaning “sacrificial bull” the first time it appears in a paragraph, and then simply bull thereafter in the paragraph.","<em>parah</em> is the feminine form of <em>par</em> and refers specifically to young cows specially fattened and reserved for sacrifice. The translation heifer is unwarranted, since in many contexts <em>parah</em> is used for a cow that has a calf. <em>parah</em>, then, is best translated simply as cow, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 4:1</span> fat cows is warranted. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 4:16</span> <em>parah</em> is used in a simile for stubbornness. This is possibly a reference to the fact that a cow that has been stall-fed for all of its life would be reluctant to move very far from its stall. It would thus probably be difficult to move when the time came to make the journey to Jerusalem for its sacrifice. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> uses “mule” in this verse, since this is the animal that is famed for stubbornness in English culture. If cows are not considered to be stubborn animals in the translator’s culture, a similar substitution can be made, if the substituted animal is one likely to have been known by the people of Bible times. It is not advisable to use a word like water buffalo since this brings with it the inference that Israel was an area of heavy rainfall.","<em>shor</em> is a general word for individual cattle. They may be male, female, or both (as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> sometimes indicates in a footnote when translating the word as “ox\"), and only the context can indicate which gender is meant. <em>shor</em> presents a problem to English translators because English has no countable equivalent. We have to use forms that specify the gender. The most common translation of this word in English is “ox\", but this is in the archaic sense of “head of cattle” and does not indicate the gender of the animal, nor whether or not it has been castrated. Some modern versions use “cow” in this same genderless sense. In other languages where there is a word for individual cows, oxen, or bulls without reference to gender, this word should be used for <em>shor</em>. If, as in English, gender has to be specified, the context can usually guide in the choice. In cases where the gender is not determined by the context, a general plural word for cattle can be used.","<em>Tor</em> is the general Aramaic word for cattle. In English the problem of quantifying results in “young bulls” being used in the Ezra passages, and “ox” in the Daniel passages. In Ezra the meaning is cattle for sacrifices, while in Daniel the reference is to cattle generally.","<em>Bous</em> is the usual Greek word for cattle, male or female. In translation a general word that may refer to a bull or a cow is the best equivalent. In John the animals driven from the Temple definitely were not “oxen” in the technical meaning of castrated bulls.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 22:4</span>: The word <em>sitistos</em> indicates stall-fed cattle that are being fattened for slaughter.","<em>Tauros</em> is the usual word for “bull\". English versions vary between “ox” and “bull\", but there really is no difference in meaning between the various contexts in the New Testament. It is recommended that translators use a word meaning “bull” throughout. Bulls were used for feasting and sacrifice (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 22:4; Heb 9:13; Heb 10:4</span>). The Greeks associated bulls (not oxen) with the gods (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 14:13</span>).","<em>Moschos</em> is the word for a male calf or bull-calf. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 7:41</span> a verb derived from <em>moschos</em>, meaning “make a bull-calf\", is used.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 9:13</span>: A word or phrase for a female calf (heifer) is the best equivalent.

types of deer (family <em>cervidae</em>) in Canaan the Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>, the Red Deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em>, and the Roe Deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em>. Of these the red deer disappeared very early before the time of the Exodus and the roe deer was confined to thick bush in remote valleys and so was probably seldom seen. Thus the fallow deer would have been the most common. It roamed wild and was also probably kept in deer parks in the days of King Solomon.","The Hebrew term <em>’ayal</em> was probably a general term for deer and for the male fallow deer in particular. <em>’Ayalah</em> and <em>’ayelet</em> are the female forms.","At the time when <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> was produced deer hunting was a very popular pastime and a number of specialized words were used to refer to deer in their different stages of development. Young male deer were called successively: knobbers - brockets - spayads - staggards - harts - stags. The English word “hart” thus actually refers to a male red deer in its fifth year when a “royal” prong forms on its antler. The word “stag” refers to the male red deer (usually the dominant male of a herd) after its sixth year when a “crown” of three prongs forms at the very top of its antlers. “Hind” refers to the female red deer of three years and upward. “Buck” refers to the male fallow deer or the male roe deer and “doe” to the females of these. This usage is reflected in the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> versions.","In modern English outside of deer-hunting circles most types of deer of either sex are called simply “deer” but if the sex is differentiated in most of the English-speaking world “stag” is usually used for the male and “doe” for the female; however, in the U.S.A. the males are called “bucks.” Young deer are often called “fawns.\""]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Deer differ from antelopes in that the males drop their antlers (horns) every year, while antelopes do not.

In summer they have a reddish fur with white spots and in the winter this coat becomes darker and the spots disappear. The bucks begin to grow antlers (branching horns) in the second year. This is at first a short unbranched prong. Each year the antlers are shed at the beginning of spring. In the third year branched antlers appear with two simple branches facing forward and the main branch growing upward. In subsequent years this main branch grows bigger flattens out and develops numerous sharp points along the edge. Eventually at the end of the fifth year each antler is double the width of the human hand in places and about 70 centimeters (2 feet) in length.","Mating takes place in autumn when the bucks utter hoarse bellowing roars.

If no generic words exist but the fallow deer is known, the word for this deer should be chosen. In other parts of the world where deer are found, if a specific rather than a generic word has to be used, the word for a large type of deer is preferable, such as the sambar deer (of India, Burma, Thailand, and western China) or the elk of North America.","Since surefootedness is not associated with deer in some parts of the world, a phrase such as “surefooted as a deer” should be used in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 22:34</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:33</span>, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hab 3:19</span> or a local animal known for its surefootedness could be substituted (see the discussion below).","In Africa, where the only deer are very small forest dwellers, it is better to use a term for an antelope that lives in herds, such as the impala, when there is a literal reference to deer. In passages where there is figurative usage, however, there is a little more leeway. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 42:1</span> for instance it would be legitimate to use the word for a local large antelope known to need water regularly, such as the wildebeest or impala. Similarly in the passages referred to above, where “surefootedness on high places” is the theme, the word for a local cliff-dwelling antelope such as the Klipspringer <em>Oreotragus oreotragus</em> or Chamois <em>Rupicapra rupicapra</em> would be legitimate. In all these cases a footnote could indicate that the Hebrew refers to a deer, although this is not strictly necessary. It is to be noted that in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 42:1</span>, while the masculine form <em>’ayal</em> is used, the corresponding verb is feminine. Where a language distinguishes between genders, it is recommended that a word be used indicating a female animal.","In the Hebrew text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:21</span> there are a number of problems. The combination of words used with the noun <em>’ayalah</em> is rather strange, since the sentence with the vowels of the Masoretic Text is literally “Naphtali is a female deer that has been sent/set free, which gives a beautiful word.” The verb “sent” is usually used of sending messengers, and the expression “a beautiful word” reinforces this possibility. The sentence could conceivably mean “Naphtali is like a deer sent out as a messenger to give beautiful news.” The point of comparison would be the speed of the deer, that is, it would describe Naphtali as a speedy messenger, which is rather strange. No major translation has ever adopted this interpretation.","Many translations have adopted the interpretation “Naphtali is a deer set free, which produces beautiful fawns” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), but this involves a very debatable emendation of the word meaning “word” or “utterance\". The point of comparison would be enjoyment of freedom on the one hand and fertility on the other. It is likely that the Masoretic Hebrew text has been corrupted at some point, and that the Greek of the Septuagint represents an earlier form of the text: “Naphtali is a spreading terebinth tree that puts forth a lovely canopy” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, and footnotes in most other versions). This translation is based on a reading of <em>’elah</em> instead of <em>’ayalah</em>. The point of comparison for both metaphors would be prosperity and fertility. A similar problem exists in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 29:9</span>, where the reading should probably be <em>’elah</em>, “terebinth tree\", rather than <em>’ayalah</em>.","In parts of the world where neither deer nor antelope are found, borrowed terms may have to be used, but these should be described in a glossary."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיָּל","transliteration":"’ayal","references":["Deut 12:15","Deut 12:22","Deut 14:5","Deut 15:22","1 Kgs 5:3","Ps 42:2","Song 2:9","Song 2:17","Song 8:14","Isa 35:6","Lam 1:6"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיָּלָה, אַיֶּלֶת","transliteration":"’ayalah, ’ayelet","references":["Gen 49:21","2 Sam 22:34","Job 39:1","Ps 18:34","Ps 22:1","Ps 29:9","Prov 5:19","Song 2:7","Song 3:5","Jer 14:5","Hab 3:19"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Deut 12:15","Deut 12:22","Deut 14:5","Deut 15:22","1 Kgs 5:3","Ps 42:2","Song 2:9","Song 2:17","Song 8:14","Isa 35:6","Lam 1:6","Gen 49:21","2 Sam 22:34","Job 39:1","Ps 18:34","Ps 22:1","Ps 29:9","Prov 5:19","Song 2:7","Song 3:5","Jer 14:5","Hab 3:19"],"crossRefs":["FAUNA:2.7"]},{"key":"2.12","book":"fauna","title":"Dog","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"כֶּלֶב","transliteration":"kelev","references":["Exod 11:7","Exod 22:30","Deut 23:19","Judg 7:5","1 Sam 17:43","1 Sam 24:15","2 Sam 3:8","2 Sam 9:8","2 Sam 16:9","1 Kgs 14:11","1 Kgs 16:4","1 Kgs 21:19","1 Kgs 21:19","1 Kgs 21:23","1 Kgs 21:24","1 Kgs 22:38","2 Kgs 8:13","2 Kgs 9:10","2 Kgs 9:36","Job 30:1","Ps 22:17","Ps 22:21","Ps 59:7","Ps 59:15","Ps 68:24","Prov 26:11","Prov 26:17","Eccl 9:4","Isa 56:10","Isa 56:11","Isa 66:3","Jer 15:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κύων","transliteration":"kuōn","references":["Matt 7:6","Luke 16:21","Phil 3:2","2 Pet 2:22","Rev 22:15","Tob 5:17","Tob 11:4","Jdt 11:19","Sir 13:18"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κυνάριον","transliteration":"kunarion","references":["Matt 15:26","Matt 15:27","Mark 7:27","Mark 7:28"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Discussion and description:","headingHtml":"Discussion and description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0184_dogs\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0184_dogs.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0184_dogs\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Dogs were domesticated very early and were used for hunting and as watchdogs in the ancient world.

When Alexander the Great extended his empire into India in the fourth century B.C. he obtained war elephants to incorporate into his army. The idea of using elephants in war then spread to the Middle East. There was a smaller variety of this elephant found in Syria and Mesopotamia. By the third century B.C. domestic Indian elephants had been introduced into Egypt. Ptolemy II is reported to have had ninety-six elephants, four to a chariot, and later that same century when Ptolemy IV defeated the Seleucid king of Syria, Antiochus III, he is reported to have captured Syrians’ elephants. However, the Seleucid kings continued to use war elephants, and the next king, Epiphanes, attacked Egypt with elephants. He and his son then used them in their campaign against the Jews. According to 1Maccabees each elephant with thirty-two soldiers mounted on it, besides the Indian handler went into battle ahead of one thousand Syrian soldiers and five hundred horsemen. One of Maccabeus’ brothers was able to kill the largest elephant by getting under it and stabbing it, but he was himself killed when the elephant fell on him. At a later time probably because the Indian elephants were difficult to obtain the African Elephant <em>Loxodonta africana</em> was tamed for use in war.

The elephant’s trunk is basically an elongated nose, but it has muscles that make it a very useful feature. With it the elephant can not only smell but can pull down branches to eat, pick berries off bushes, draw up water to squirt into its mouth or over its body, and can use it as a weapon. On either side of the trunk the males grow long tusks that are often over 2 meters (6 feet) in length. These are used for digging up roots, gouging bark off trees, and lifting logs.

They were domesticated very early in the Middle East. Both longhaired and shorthaired breeds were known, the former being raised for its hair, and the latter for its milk, meat, and skin. The shorthaired type was probably the Nubian Goat <em>Capra hircus mambrica</em>, a floppy-eared breed with black and white, or brown and white, patches. The longhaired breed was also floppy-eared, of the Angora type, <em>Capra hircus angorensis</em>. It was usually black with long silky fur.","Three passages in the Bible seem to liken this hair to human hair: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 4:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 6:5</span>, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 19:13</span>.","Goats were very important to the early Israelites. Like sheep they were a source of meat, milk, hides, hair, and horns. They prefer to browse on leaves and shoots rather than graze and thus do not compete with sheep for the grass in fact they can survive on desert shrubs even where there is no grass. They are excellent survivors of drought or desert conditions.","Goats were herded together with sheep although sheep were more numerous. Goats were actually quite helpful to the shepherds. While sheep are very dependent on each other lacking in self-confidence and thus tending to bunch together closely goats move about confidently in scattered groups following the general lead of a dominant male. When sheep and goats are herded together the goats feed on the shrubs on the slopes or edges of the valleys while the sheep keep to the grass on the more level areas. The goats scatter and the sheep follow their lead and thus graze in a more scattered pattern when with goats with all benefiting from the less dense grazing.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0267_goats_herd\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0267_goats_herd.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0267_goats_herd\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The goats also have a better sense of direction and since the sheep follow the goats there is less likelihood of sheep getting lost.

However killing female goats is not a good policy as they are the reproducers. So even in Bible times young goats (kids) usually male were killed for food. It is also possible that castrated male goats were kept for butchering.","Goat hair was used to make tents and warm coats and for stuffing pillows and saddles.","The floppy-eared goats of the Middle East are not as easy to differentiate from sheep as other types of goat may be.

Among some species of hare there is a phenomenon called “refection” which has a result something like the chewing of cud in that it involves chewing the same food twice. Among these hares two different types of dropping are produced. One type consisting of partially digested food is eaten by the hares. Some writers have suggested that this is what is referred to by the biblical expression “chewing the cud\". However this phenomenon has not been seen among Middle Eastern hares.","The prohibition is strictly a religious or ritual one as hares are an important food in many countries. There is nothing particularly “unclean” about hares. Their habits are certainly no less clean than those of goats."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Hares are smallish, light brown animals about half a meter (20 inches) long, with long ears and short fluffy tails.

They were first domesticated in the central Asian and Mongolian grasslands, the original home of the eastern wild horse, sometime before 2000 B.C. (The European wild horse was domesticated considerably later.) By 1700 B.C. horses had been imported into Canaan and Egypt. The fact that horses were imported made them very expensive, and for centuries horses were only owned by kings and wealthy local chiefs. Their military potential was soon recognized, and armies that were equipped with war chariots and had soldiers on horseback had an enormous advantage over those that did not. Horses gave armies a mobility they had never had before, and completely changed battle tactics.","In more recent times, horses have been carried abroad by European colonists and introduced to virtually every country on earth. The so-called “wild horses” of Spain, France, the Americas, and Australia are actually domesticated horses that have returned to their wild state.","Joseph, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 47:17</span> (the first mention of horses in the Bible), used the widespread famine and Egypt’s store of grain as an opportunity to obtain horses for the Pharaoh. He thus weakened the neighboring tribes, while giving Pharaoh’s army better military capability. It is ironic that these horses were later used against Israelites under Moses.","The Canaanites also had horses and chariots, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 17:16</span> the people of Israel were prohibited from acquiring horses, as this was seen as weakening their reliance on God. Militarily they were thus at a considerable disadvantage in their wars against the Canaanite tribes. They counteracted this disadvantage by concentrating on fighting in the hill country, or occasionally in swampy land (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 4:7; Judg 5:19; Judg 5:20; Judg 5:21</span>), where chariots were useless. They cut the hamstring tendon at the back of the hind legs on captured horses, rendering them useless to both Canaanites and themselves (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 11:9</span>). Even so, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 1:19</span> states that “Judah drove out the inhabitants of the mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys because they had iron chariots” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>; compare also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","Joshua, Saul, and David seem to have heeded the warning not to acquire horses. However, David finally gave in to the temptation, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 8:4</span> we read that although he hamstrung most of the captured horses, he kept a hundred for himself. The advantage that he gained was later turned against him when two of his sons, Absalom (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 15:1</span>) and Adonijah (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 1:5</span>), equipped themselves with horses from David’s stables in preparation for their revolts against him.","However, it was Solomon who made horses and chariots a major component of the Israelite army. He imported horses from Egypt and Cilicia at a cost of 150 shekels each, and he received horses as part of the annual tax paid to him by smaller states. He eventually collected 12,000 horses, which were stabled in a number of towns (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:26</span> ff.)."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Most horses in Bible times were probably very different from today’s riding or workhorses.

Stallions neigh and fight each other to establish which is dominant, especially when they are in the presence of mares. This is what is possibly referred to in the Jeremiah passage.","The word <em>’abir</em> literally means “mighty ones” and possibly could be a reference to exceptionally big, strong stallion war-horses, of the kind called “chargers” or “steeds” in archaic English. In many languages it will be best translated by a phrase meaning something like “fierce horse\", or with a more figurative phrase such as “warrior horse” or “chief horse\". In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 50:11</span> the fact that this is a male horse is important, since this verse refers to the uncontrollable nature of stallions, especially when in the presence of female horses and other stallions.","<em>sus</em> and <em>hippos</em> are the general words for horse in the Old and New Testaments respectively. In the Old Testament the feminine form <em>susah</em> occurs once, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 1:9</span>. See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:3.23\">3.23 Swift, swallow</a> for discussion of another meaning for <em>sus</em>.","The word <em>parash</em>, which occurs over fifty times, normally refers to a war-horse and its rider as a single military unit, a mounted trooper. In the plural it usually means cavalry or a mounted battalion. (A similar usage is to be found in some of the deuterocanonical references to <em>hippos</em>, which is also the word used in the Septuagint to translate <em>parash</em>.) <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> (the latter in footnotes) take it to mean “charioteers\". This word is best translated as “soldiers on horses” in most passages, with the exception of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:25</span>, where cavalry horses seem to be referred to, without reference to the riders. In these two passages there is a difference in numbers. In the Hebrew text <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> refers to 40,000 stables, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:25</span> to 4,000 stables.

It appears that this unusual translation in turn is the result of opting for the figure four thousand. If the forty thousand of the Hebrew text were accepted, there would then be forty thousand stalls for chariot horses, but only twelve thousand horses!","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> tries to avoid this pitfall with “Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.” However, this actually also equates <em>parash</em> with “chariot horse\", which it does not and cannot do in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has “Solomon also had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.” This translation of <em>parash</em> is consistent, but it ignores the difference in context. The narrator would then be counting stables and horsemen in the same phrase, which is highly unlikely.","The majority of commentaries and the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr>) accept the Hebrew text (forty thousand) as the better text for this verse. This is reflected by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> ’s “Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","Since <em>parash</em> refers in different contexts to (a) war-horses and their riders, (b) only the riders, or (c) only the war-horses, this translation as cavalry horses is consistent. An option would be “war-horses” or “horses for war\". The Hebrew text seems, on the surface, to give forty thousand as the number of stables, but it is possible that the writer intended to indicate the number of horses stabled there.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> footnote, “charioteers\", for <em>parash</em> has very little support.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>: The generally accepted exegesis of this verse is “Solomon had four thousand outbuildings for his chariots and horses, and had twelve thousand cavalry horses” (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). This rendering accepts an inconsistency between <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 9:25</span>.","A solution, which is defensible, and which avoids the inconsistency, is to follow the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 4:26</span> “stables for forty thousand chariot horses,” and the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> rendering of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:25</span> “four thousand stalls,” since it is possible to house forty thousand horses in four thousand stables.

There are scholars who trace the modern Arabian breed of horse back to the ancient <em>rekesh</em>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 1:13</span>: The context in this verse is one of haste, and the

Thus the “speckled screamer” is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) and by others to mean “hyena” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>). However, there are also scholars who relate <em>‘ayit</em> to a different Hebrew root that means “to attack greedily” and take <em>‘ayit</em> to mean “prey” or even “carrion\".

It is recommended that this exegesis be followed. Another possible rendering of the phrase could even be a place of scavenging hyenas.","There is considerable doubt about the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>tsiyim</em> and different translations have marmots, wild animals, wild cats, desert animals and even sharks and dolphins. It is clear that the word refers to a specific dangerous wild animal (possibly which lives in the desert) often associated with destruction and with jackals. Although not mentioned at all in the English versions there are many scholars zoologists among them who interpret this word as referring to the hyena.","The uncertainty surrounding the word relates to the fact that nobody is sure what other Hebrew words <em>tsiyim</em> is related to. Some relate it to a word for “desert\", thus “desert creature\". This interpretation does not exclude the hyena and in fact since the references seem to be to a specific animal rather than to desert animals in general the contexts would all fit “hyena” well. The trend among scholars today is to associate it with a word that disappeared early from Hebrew meaning “to wail or yelp\". The fairly obvious conclusion from this would be that the word means “the wailer\", that is the hyena.","The translations “shark\", “dolphin” and “marmot” can be dismissed as very doubtful, especially “marmot\", which is an animal that lives in high mountain environments and has never lived in the land of Israel.","The Striped Hyena <em>Hyaena hyaena</em> has been a very well-known and common animal in the Middle East since time immemorial.

In later English “rabbit” came to be used for the adults as well. “Coney” then dropped out of use except among fur traders. However it is certain that the Hebrew word <em>shafan</em> does not mean “rabbit” so the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translation “coney” was incorrect. In the nineteenth century, Bible readers perhaps not being sure what a “coney” was, came to identify the “coney” with the Syrian hyrax, probably as the result of hearing preachers describe the animal. To these readers then “coney” acquired a new meaning that it had nowhere else. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> use of “coney” is thus both archaic and incorrect.","<strong>Badger</strong>: Two types of badger live in the land of Israel.

Thus those versions using “badger” are likewise incorrect.","<strong>Rock badger</strong>: Mystery surrounds the name “rock badger\". There was no known animal popularly called a “rock badger” prior to the release of the Brown, Driver, and Briggs translation of Gesenius’ Hebrew Lexicon in 1906. In this lexicon apparently for the first time, “rock badger” appears as the translation of the Hebrew <em>shafan</em>. It is unclear why they coined this new word in preference to the more common “rock rabbit\", but it was probably the result of translating the Cape Dutch <em>klip dassie</em> (\"little rock badger\") too literally. However “rock badger” has been used by most English translators ever since. Both “coney” and “rock badger” are, however, not only basically meaningless to most readers but are also incorrect.","The animal referred to by the Hebrew word <em>shafan</em> is undoubtedly the Syrian Rock Hyrax <em>Procavia capensis syriaca</em>. This identification was first made by Canon Tristram in 1867 and has been confirmed many times since. It is a very common animal in the Middle East and Africa eats only vegetation and lives among the rocks.","In southern and eastern Africa other subspecies of the Hyrax <em>Procavia capensis</em> and the Yellow-spotted Hyrax <em>Heterohyrax brucei</em> are sometimes called “rock rabbit\", but are more usually called by the Afrikaans name “dassie\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Hyraxes are found only in the Middle East and Africa.

The structure of their jaws, teeth, and feet and the size of their prehistoric ancestors link them to the rhinoceros and elephant.","Two of their top front teeth develop into small tusks which sometimes protrude from the side of their mouth. They have four toes on their front feet and three on the back feet. These toes do not have claws but each has a small hoof-like nail. The soles of their feet are perpetually clammy, being lubricated by a special gland. This enables them to run up almost vertical rock faces and climb trees with ease. In the middle of their back they have another large gland covered with an oval patch of hairs of a different color. These hairs can be raised as an alarm signal.","For such small mammals hyraxes have a very long gestation period of seven months. They live in fairly large family groups and since they are unable to regulate their body temperature by perspiring they huddle together in cavities under rocks when the weather is cold and lie stretched out in breezy locations in the shade of the rocks or trees when it is hot.

The word “jackal” was borrowed from the Arabic <em>jakal</em> which is from the same Semitic root as the Hebrew word <em>shu‘al</em>. In the days of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> the word “jackal” had not yet been introduced into the English language and so in that version “fox” is used throughout for <em>shu‘al</em>.","Modern scholars are almost unanimous in agreeing that the word <em>’iyim</em> (plural of <em>’iy</em>) is derived from a root meaning “to howl” and that it refers to howling jackals in particular. The word usually occurs in conjunction with the word <em>tsiyim</em> (\"hyenas\") which is derived from a root meaning “to wail\". The pair together could justifiably be interpreted as “wild animals wailing and howling.” This is usually taken to refer to hyenas and jackals.","The context will usually indicate which animal is being referred to in a particular passage. It is possible that the fox was known as the small <em>shu‘al</em> and the jackal as the large one.","In early Hebrew the plural form <em>tanin</em> from <em>tan</em> meant a type of snake. This usage is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 7:9; Exod 7:10; Exod 7:12; Deut 32:33; Ps 91:13</span>. The same word was the name of a mythical monster or sea serpent. This usage occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:21; Job 7:12; Ps 74:13; Ps 148:7; Isa 27:1; Isa 51:9; Jer 51:34; Ezek 29:3; Ezek 32:2</span>. However, it is well accepted now that, in later Hebrew, <em>tan</em> is a poetic name for the jackal. It derives from a stem meaning to recite, or lament. In the passages where snakes or the monster <em>tanin</em> is referred to the context usually indicates that it cannot refer to jackals. These passages are discussed further in <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:4.9\">4.9 Snake</a> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:7.2\">7.2 Dragon, sea monster</a>."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0214_fennec\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0214_fennec.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0214_fennec\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure><strong>Fox</strong>: All foxes look like small, longhaired dogs with pointed noses. The Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> (also <em>Vulpes flavescens</em>) is now very common all over Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, China, Japan, North America, and Australasia, having been introduced into the latter two continents to be hunted on horseback with packs of dogs. The red fox is a smallish animal, about 1 meter (3 feet) from nose to tip of the tail. It is usually reddish with white underparts and a bushy tail. Red foxes feed mainly on mice and rats but also eat chickens, game birds, and fallen fruit. They may occasionally eat carrion (dead animals), but are not scavengers in the usual sense of the word.","The Desert Fox <em>Vulpes ruppelli</em> and the Egyptian Fox <em>Vulpes nilotica</em> are slightly smaller and yellowish brown, but they are otherwise very similar to the red fox. The Fennec <em>Vulpes zerda</em> is a very small fox with large ears. It is now found in the Middle East and Egypt and was probably found in Israel also in earlier times. It feeds on insects and mice.","Foxes live in pairs, singly or in small family groups when they have young. During the day they live in holes in the ground usually dug by some other animal and come out at night to feed. When chased by dogs they are very clever at escaping, often doubling back on their tracks and then jumping sideways and heading in a new direction, thus confusing the scent trail. They also run up streams and thus avoid laying a scent trail altogether.","<strong>Jackal</strong>: The jackal found in Israel is the Golden or Oriental Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>. It is also sometimes referred to as the Indian jackal. This animal is larger than the fox. It is yellowish brown with black tips to the long fur on its back.","Jackals eat almost anything and are great opportunists moving very fast with clever tactics when they have to. They have been known to steal bread from people’s houses and baby animals even from dangerous wild pigs. They are scavengers, eating household rubbish as well as carrion, especially the remains of carcasses killed by lions, but they also eat beetles and birds’ eggs and kill small mammals game birds and domestic chickens and ducks.","In some of the literature there is reference to the fact that jackals live in packs. This is not strictly correct. They live in pairs or small family groups but they may associate temporarily in larger groups when many pairs are attracted to the same burrows, carrion, refuse dumps, or potential prey. In these larger temporary groups they may cooperate and act together like a pack.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0541_jackal\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0541_jackal.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0541_jackal\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Jackals live in burrows made by other animals or in abandoned human houses or shelters and emerge to feed at night.

Similar fables about opportunistic jackals have been widespread in Africa and the Middle East for centuries.","In ancient Arabic literature and in the Talmud and Midrash the word “lion” stands for a truly great and powerful person. In contrast “jackal” is used to designate an insignificant but self-important person. Since this figurative usage of “lion” (or “lioness\") is also common in the Bible there is a strong probability that the term “jackal” or “fox” used as a metaphor in the Bible for a person carries the connotation of self-important insignificance.","However the main symbolism associated with the jackal in the Bible is related to its habit of living among ruins and feeding on carcasses. To say that a certain place would become the dwelling place of jackals meant that the place would become deserted and lie in ruins, as the result of war. The jackal was thus a symbol of death and desolation as well as insignificance and opportunistic craftiness."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In areas where jackals are known, but not foxes, the word for jackal can be used for both.

These spots make it very easy for a leopard to blend in with patches of shade and sunlight in or under bushes and trees. They are extremely agile, and this agility and their natural camouflage are used to the full in their hunting methods. They stalk gazelles, antelope, or deer (occasionally goats or sheep) until they are within ten or fifteen meters (30-50 feet) or less. They then break cover and leap onto their prey. They have a slightly different strategy when hunting monkeys and baboons. They drive them to the extreme ends of branches by climbing after them, and when the monkey or baboon finally drops from the tree, the leopard leaps after it and catches it on the ground.","Once a leopard has killed an animal, it carries it into a tree or onto a high rock to eat, possibly to get away from hyenas. Once a leopard has satisfied its appetite, if there is still meat left on the carcass, it will leave the carcass in the fork of a branch and return to feed again later. The exception to this is when a female has cubs. She will then carry the kill to her cubs in a lair under rocks or a log, but she will still carry any leftover meat into a tree to store in the branches.

A closer study of lions and their behavior may help to define these meanings.","In biblical times lions were found all over the Middle East, in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, and in the area of Sudan and Ethiopia called Cush.","The Greek word <em>leōn</em> and the Latin <em>leo</em> are general words for lion, while the Greek <em>leontēdon</em> means something like “fierce lion\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In order to dispel many of the wrong presuppositions about lions that are current among biblical scholars, the description of this animal will be more detailed and extensive than for other animals in this book.","Lions <em>Panthera leo</em> are the largest of the great cats, often being about 2.8 meters (9 feet) from nose to tip of tail, standing as high as 1 meter (3 feet 3 inches) at the shoulder. However, the difference in size between lions and Bengal Tigers <em>Panthera tigris</em> is minimal. An adult lion is at least half a meter (20 inches) longer than a Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and weighs twice as much, often reaching 250 kilograms (550 pounds) in weight; it is about 30 centimeters (1 foot) longer and 100 kilograms (220 pounds) heavier than a Jaguar <em>Panthera onca</em> or Mountain Lion (Puma) <em>Puma concolor</em>. Lions are a pale yellowish brown, but at birth they have spots that usually disappear gradually as they grow. Around the neck and shoulders of adult males grows a mane that is darker than the rest of their fur. Some even have black manes. Females and young males do not have manes and look very similar to each other.","<strong>Social behavior</strong>: Lions live in family groups called “prides\", which are made up of a dominant male lion (often called “the pride male\"), plus a group of adult and sub adult females and young males. Males may leave the pride, and occasionally one or two females may go off with a wandering male, but normally the females continue in the pride and develop very close bonds with one another that last a lifetime. The dominant male will often make ritual attacks on the younger males of the pride, who roll over in submission rather than fight.","However, adult males from within and outside the pride challenge the dominant male and one another when a female is in season and will try to mate with her. This results in serious fights. If the dominant male is defeated from within the pride, he leaves the pride to wander alone, but the remainder of the pride remains intact. If a male from outside the pride takes over from the pride male, he usually chases away the other males, which then wander singly or in small groups of three or four. These wandering males will try to take over other prides or steal females from them. Ousted pride males, since they are alone and have no help in hunting, are often hungry, thin, undernourished, and dangerous.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0595_lioness_cub\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0595_lioness_cub.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0595_lioness_cub\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>About two or three days before a pregnant female is about to give birth to cubs, she digs a temporary den under a rock or fallen log and visits it with one or two of the other females. After she gives birth in the den, one of the other females will bring her meat from a kill. This enables the mother to remain with her newborn cubs continuously for the first week or two of their lives. The mother lioness moves the newborn cubs to a new den every three or four days. When the cubs are about two weeks old, the mother carries the cubs to where the other pride members are, and the pride makes their acquaintance by licking them. Thereafter the cubs belong to the pride and suckle on any lactating lioness that happens to be near.","Until they are old enough to hunt, cubs hide in thickets while the pride hunters do their work. At a later stage they accompany the hunting lions, but watch the killing from the sidelines. Finally the mother will help them kill small animals, until they are able to kill efficiently. Then they join the pride hunts.","A pride lives together in the same territory. Bushes and tree trunks are marked by spraying a liquid from a gland next to the anus. This marked territory is defended against intruding lions. The pride will come together at feeding time and remain together after a feed, but will scatter across the territory prior to hunting.","<strong>Vocal behavior</strong>: Lions utter a variety of sounds, and this should be borne in mind when translating Scripture passages that refer to the noises lions make. The Hebrew words are usually not very specific, but the context will indicate the type of noise intended.","Roaring is the loudest of the lion sounds and is usually produced by the males. It is believed to be territory-marking behavior and a means of maintaining pride solidarity. It is usually done before hunting begins and also functions to help the pride locate the positions of scattered members. This is important for hunting. Roaring consists of a long, very loud moaning sound followed by shorter rhythmic panting moans, which are repeated as many as twenty times, while becoming softer and softer. No two lions roar in exactly the same way, and they can be identified from their roars. Roaring is also a means by which wandering male lions make known their availability as potential mates. Hungry lions roar more frequently than well-fed ones, and this is an indication of how hungry they are.","Growling is a warning sound. It is a very deep rumbling repeated with each breath. It is intended to chase away strange lions or other potential enemies, such as leopards, hyenas, or humans. When a lion or lioness growls, it usually advances towards its enemy. If growling does not have the desired effect, it is replaced with snarling, which is similar to growling but is more intense and is produced with exposed teeth, the body in a low crouch, and ears laid back flat. This behavior is usually the prelude to an attack. When the attack is actually made on an enemy, a deep trembling moan is uttered, and the ensuing fight takes place with a lot of loud snarling and growling.","When lions are feeding together on one carcass, there is usually a lot of growling, snarling, and snapping among the feeding lions.","Other types of sound made by lions are:","woofing sounds when pride members meet after two or three days’ absence from each other. This sound is also used to call cubs from their hiding places;","- drawn out yawning moans by females in heat and by both lions and lionesses when mating;","- grunting sounds when chasing prey toward other lions waiting in ambush;","- contented loud purring, much as cats do.","<strong>Hunting and feeding behavior</strong>: After lions have fed well, they rest and relax together for two or three days. Towards the end of this time some of the pride members will begin to move away from the others in the direction of places where prey animals are likely to be grazing. Then, before they begin to hunt, they signal their locations by roaring on and off for an hour or two. They then fall silent and begin to hunt in earnest. Hunting usually takes one of two forms. If there is good cover near the prey, two or three lionesses and young males will stalk the prey using the cover. When they get close enough, one or two will break cover and charge at the prey, while the others maneuver to cut off any escape.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0593_lion\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0593_lion.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0593_lion\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>If the terrain is more open, the lionesses and young males will take up ambush positions downwind of the prey animals. Adult males then move fairly openly into upwind positions. They then run toward the prey uttering loud grunts with each breath. With either method, at the first charge the lions try to disable the animal by seizing a leg or by biting the spine. Once they have slowed down the prey, one lion will seize the animal by the throat and suffocate it. Thus death is usually fairly slow and drawn out. If the animal is large, the kill takes a considerable amount of energy, and the lions rest, usually standing, before they begin to feed.","Single wandering male lions are at a great disadvantage in hunting and often go hungry. They thus roar more frequently than pride lions. They often begin to kill domestic animals and sometimes humans.","Among the lions present at the time of the kill, there is a type of seniority, with age being important. The most senior lion or lioness present will begin to feed, and this will be a signal for the others to join in. If the kill is large, they feed in relative silence, but if the prey is small, there is a lot of snarling, growling, and snapping. Whenever a dominant pride male arrives, however, the feeding lions withdraw and leave him to feed alone. A dominant male will sometimes allow an immature cub to feed with him but no mature lions. The pride members will only resume feeding when the dominant male is satisfied. Dominant males are very seldom involved in the chase or the kill. At most they make the charge that drives the prey towards lionesses and young males in ambush."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"special significance or symbolism","heading":"Special significance or symbolism:","headingHtml":"Special significance or symbolism:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In the Bible the lion is a symbol of danger and destruction, often being paired with the bear. The lion is also a symbol of great political power and regal majesty."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Before discussing specific passages in detail, it is useful first to try and identify the various Hebrew words with likely lion types.","If we examine the verbs and adjectives with which the Hebrew nouns co-occur, we find the following:","<em>’Ari</em>: This, the most frequently used word for lion, is associated with a very wide range of verbs in the Bible, including crouching in ambush, leaping, growling, roaring, killing, destroying, tearing prey to pieces, breaking bones, attacking, breaking from cover, scattering sheep, trampling, and standing on prey. The adjectives used with this noun include strong, destructive, brave, and hungry.","From this evidence we can see that <em>’ari</em> or its feminine form <em>’aryeh</em> is the general word for lion or lioness.","<em>’Aryeh</em>: Although this is a feminine form, in English versions it is invariably translated as “lion\", because this form usually occurs in the Hebrew phrase <em>gur ’aryeh</em>, which is literally “a cub of lioness\", but which is more naturally translated as “lion cub” in English.","<em>Beney shachats</em>: This expression, which literally means “sons of pride\", occurs only once, in a poetic passage (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 28:8</span>) as the parallel of “lion” (<em>shachal</em>). Probably, besides having similar sounds, the two expressions both refer to lions. Only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> reflects this in the translation.","<em>Kefir</em>: The verbs associated with this noun include kill, prowl, hunt, snarl, attack, break cover, tear prey to pieces, roar, and growl. The only adjective associated with the noun is “angry\". Translators often render this as “young lion\". <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 19:1–Ezek 19:9</span> seems to support an identification of <em>kefir</em> with a young male lion that is an efficient killer (see the discussion of this passage below).","<em>Laviy’</em>: The verbs associated with this noun are growling, devouring, lying down, crouching, and raising cubs. The only descriptive phrase that co-occurs is big teeth. The usual <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> rendering of this word as “lioness” seems well founded.","<em>Layish</em>: This noun occurs only three times. The verb phrase that co-occurs is “ dying from lack of prey\". The adjectives that co-occur are “stately in its walk\", and “strong\". The evidence would fit an interpretation such as “lion in its prime time” or “mighty lion\". The reference would seem to be to a dominant male lion or “pride male\". Versions that render this word as “old lion” in some contexts (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), seem to be slightly misleading.","<em>Shachal</em>: The verbs that co-occur are roaring, hunting, and tearing prey to pieces. Some scholars, using evidence from Assyrian and classical Arabic, believe that this Hebrew word is derived from an older Semitic root meaning “to roar” or “to produce a call\". All available evidence would seem to allow for the interpretation of <em>shachal</em> as “male lion\". It may possibly be a word for a wandering male lion rather than a male that is a member of a pride.","In some English versions of Maccabees the Greek word <em>skumnos</em> is incorrectly translated as “cub” or “whelp\". The context refers to this creature roaring, which lion cubs do not do. The word seems rather to refer to a virile young adult lion. It is better translated as lion in its prime compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> “like a ferocious lion.\"","In areas where lions are completely unknown, it is better to borrow a word from a dominant language or from Hebrew or Greek, rather than to try and find a local equivalent. This is because the biblical references to the behavior of lions are fairly specific, and if a word for a local animal is used, it will not fit the behavior mentioned in the text. This is especially so because the lion is the only great cat (apart from the cheetah) that lives and hunts in large family groups.","Some attempt should be made to maintain the slight differences in meaning of the various Hebrew words for lions, when the context requires this. This can often be done by using short, natural-sounding descriptive phrases. Often, however, in contexts where only one of the Hebrew words for lion is used, there is no need to maintain a difference, and a simple word for lion or lioness will suffice.","The most common Hebrew phrases used for the sounds lions make are <em>sha’ag</em>, <em>(natan) qol</em>, <em>naham</em>. When <em>sha’ag</em> is used in contexts of human vocal behavior, it indicates cries of pain or distress. In contexts of animal vocal behavior, however, it can signal pain and distress but can also be an aggressive sound and can be translated “bellow, roar, moan, snarl, growl” or sometimes “bark\". A similar Arabic word usually refers to the lowing of cattle or the bleating of goats. For lions English translators have consistently chosen “roar\", because of their mistaken preconception that a lion’s “roar” is an aggressive sound. In most contexts it is best interpreted as “growl” or “snarl\".","(<em>Natan</em>) <em>qol</em>, on the other hand, is a more general expression and can mean any sort of vocalization, from calling, to groaning or singing. English translators of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> have chosen “growl” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) and “cry out” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). In this text this word is the parallel of <em>sha’ag</em>, so the reason for these interpretations is plain. However, a neutral translation, such as “make a sound\", would be equally valid. Of all the Hebrew expressions for lion sounds, this is the one most likely to mean roar, especially in contexts where the noun <em>shachal</em> occurs for “lion\", as for example in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 4:10</span>.","<em>Naham</em> means to moan in sorrow or pain when used of humans and is usually translated as to growl when used of animals.","<strong>Lion habitats and the meaning of <em>ma‘on</em> in the context of lions</strong>: Generally the word <em>ma‘on</em> means dwelling place, hiding place, or refuge. In one or two places it refers to a military refuge or fortress. When used of animals, it can mean “lair” (as for jackals), “hiding place\", “territory\", or simply “place where the animals are found\". The choice in translating this Hebrew word has been either “lair” or “den” in all English translations. This choice again seems to be related to the misconceptions about the behavior of lions. Lions do not usually live in dens or lairs, and it is better to translate <em>ma‘on</em> as “territory” or “place where lions live\". See the discussion below for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:8; Gen 49:10</span>: The major problems in interpreting this passage relate to the meaning of the verb <em>‘alah</em>. TEV, REB, and NIV interpret <span class=\"scripture-ref\">‘alah</span> in verse 9 as “return” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> even has “return to his den\"). However, the more usual meaning of the Hebrew verb is “to rise up\", and in this context this makes perfect sense. As mentioned above, when a lion has killed its prey, the lion usually stands up, panting, and rests in this position for some minutes before crouching down again to start feeding.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 4:10; Job 4:11</span>: In this passage there is clearly a logical link between the fact that the teeth of the efficient killers (<em>kefirim</em>) are broken and the fact that the dominant male (<em>layish</em>) is dying because no kills have been made. Most English translations translate <em>taref</em> as “prey\", which infers that the problem is a lack of animals to hunt. It would be better to translate this word as “kills\", that is, animals that have been killed.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 22:13</span>: The Hebrew of this passage indicates clearly that the growling or snarling and the tearing at prey are directed at the writer.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:38; Jer 51:39</span>: The English translations that take <em>kefir</em> to mean “young lions” misrepresent slightly the picture portrayed in this verse. Rather than being the immature roar of young lions, the text refers to the frightening roar of hungry hunting lions.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 19:1; Ezek 19:9</span>: In this passage the picture of a lioness training her cubs to become efficient killers is clearly presented. This gives us a good indication of the meaning of <em>kefir</em>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 11:10</span>: The picture here is of a lion roaring and the other members of the pride coming in response. The picture given in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> of God roaring at his enemies is not justified.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span>: A choice has to be made about the type of vocalizing the lion is doing, and why. If, as the existing text seems to require, the presupposition is that the lion has caught its prey, then the translation of <em>sha’ag</em> and <em>natan qol</em> will involve appropriate choices. “Snarl” and “growl” seem to be legitimate. These fit the context, match real lion behavior, and are still valid translations of the Hebrew roots.","Next, it is necessary to make a suitable choice for <em>ma‘on</em>. “The place where it hides” would be quite appropriate, paralleling “bush” in the first line of the couplet.","The two words for lion in this verse are <em>’aryeh</em> and <em>kefir</em>. The first should be rendered “lioness” and the second “lion” or “killer lion\".","<em>A Translator’s Handbook on the Book of Amos</em> can thus be rephrased: “The snarling in the first line and the growling in the second both refer to the warning sounds lions make when feeding together.\"","Figure 13 in the Amos Handbook gives an analysis in which the relationship of this verse to the argument is seen as being the theme “Disaster\", presumably that which has befallen the prey. However, if the lion is consistently seen as the symbol of God, then one would expect <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> to be seen as inferring that God is “roaring” (to use the Handbook’s interpretation) because a disaster has already befallen the nation of Israel, just as a “lion roars because it has caught its prey\". Yet in the corresponding element of the chiasmus, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a, the analysis in the Handbook identifies the disaster as being in the future, since the “roar” is interpreted as a warning. The analysis is thus not cohesive at these points.","If, however, the growling and snarling (rather than roaring) refer to the aggressive behavior of feeding lions toward each other and toward other predators and scavengers, their behavior would be more closely related to warning than to destroying. This shows better cohesion between <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:4</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a. If <em>sha’ag</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 3:8</span> a is also translated “snarl\", the warning effect is greatly heightened.","The labels on the Handbook’s chiastic structure would now be:","A Harmony","B Warning signs","C Disaster","D Confusion","C' Disaster","B' Warning signs","A' Harmony","Interestingly enough this alternate translation does not change the basic arguments as identified by the Handbook, but strengthens them.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 2:11; Mic 2:12</span>: The major problems of interpretation in this verse, have been the word <em>kefir</em>, usually translated here as “cubs\", and the words <em>ma‘on</em>, <em>mir‘eh</em>, and <em>chor</em>, usually translated as “den\", “lair\", and “cave\".","In RSV, NEB, and REB, the presupposition is that lions live in dens, to which they carry their prey, and that the male lion in the passage tears up a carcass to feed to the lionesses and cubs. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> shares this presupposition but adds the idea that lion cubs are fed in the den. But, as we have seen, lions do not live in dens, and male lions do not tear up carcasses to feed cubs. And they certainly do not feed lionesses; they usually compete with them for the meat.","A better interpretation is to take <em>kefir</em> in the same way as in the previous passages, that is, as killer lion. <em>Ma‘on</em> seems to mean “dwelling place, territory” in this context. <em>Mir‘eh</em> is interpreted in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> as “feeding place\", which fits the context well. This leaves <em>chor</em>, which functions here as a parallel expression to <em>me‘onot</em> “territories\". <em>Chor</em> normally means “hole” or “cave” and can be taken to refer to the temporary dens where suckling lionesses are fed by other lionesses."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲרִי, אַרְיֵה","transliteration":"’ari, ’aryeh","references":["Gen 49:9","Gen 49:9","Num

The domesticated pig was known in Egypt around 2500 B.C. and was probably domesticated in Canaan about that time too. Domestication of wild pigs seems to have coincided everywhere with the development of agriculture. Wild pigs were probably penned in large enclosures and fed scraps, thus keeping them away from planted fields. Later on, when full domestication had taken place, it was more usual for pigs to be herded rather than kept in pens. Pigs eat almost anything and herding did away with the necessity to feed them. It soon was noticed that the rooting activity of the pigs rid areas of tree roots and shrubs and promoted the growth of grass for grazing. So early swineherds herded the pigs into areas where future grazing was wanted, away from planted fields. Jews who kept pigs may not have done so with the idea of eating their meat, which was unclean, but to promote grazing grass and to sell the pigs to neighboring tribes.","Wild pigs, in the form of the European Boar <em>Sus scrofus</em>, were once abundant in Israel, especially in the Jordan Valley. Even now since neither Jews nor Moslems eat the meat of wild pigs, and thus do not hunt them, they can still be found in the Jordan Valley and in many other areas where there is both water and thick undergrowth.","The Greek words <em>choiros</em> and <em>hueios</em> mean “pig” or “pig meat\".

of Abraham at least five breeds of sheep had already been developed in Mesopotamia. From mummified remains (that is, preserved dead bodies) and ancient art it is also known that at least two different breeds had reached Egypt by about 2000 B.C. Thus it is likely that the sheep mentioned in the Bible were of more than one breed.","The Hebrew word <em>kar</em> seems to be used of imported foreign sheep and may refer to a special breed but some scholars think it refers to a wether (castrated ram), since this word is never used in the context of sacrifice. This word is also used for a battering ram, that is, a heavy pole suspended on a rope, used in war for breaking down walls. <em>’Ayil</em> is the word for a ram or adult male sheep, <em>rachel</em> is a breeding ewe or female sheep, and <em>taleh</em> is a very young lamb, probably still unweaned. The remaining Hebrew words refer to sheep in general.","The Greek word <em>probaton</em> is the general word for sheep, or flocks that may include goats. <em>Krios</em> is the Greek word for a ram or male sheep. <em>Pascha</em> is a technical name for the Passover lamb exclusively, and the remaining Greek words all mean lamb. <em>Ovis</em> is the Latin word for sheep.","The early Hebrews were nomadic shepherds to whom sheep were the most important domestic animal. While goats eat almost any vegetation, sheep are much more selective about the grasses and plants they eat. This meant that suitable grazing for them was not always easy to find, and shepherds had to keep moving their flocks from place to place. This led to a nomadic lifestyle, with movable tents rather than houses being the normal household shelter. It was not until the occupation of Canaan after the Exodus that the lifestyle of the Israelites changed, and they became settled village-dwelling farmers and fruit growers.","However, even then, most households owned sheep, and some family members would function as shepherds, often living away from home for fairly long periods.","Sheep in the Bible were a source of meat, milk, wool, hides, and horns, and it seems likely that various strains were bred selectively to enhance production of these commodities. Wool is mentioned in the Bible as early as the Mosaic Law, which forbade the weaving of cloth containing both wool and plant fibers. The shearing of sheep is mentioned even earlier, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 31:19</span>. Wool was in fact the most common and available fiber known to the people of Israel.","There was a very extensive wool trade in biblical times, stretching from Egypt to China. In the Middle East wool was cheaper than cotton or linen, which were the other common fibers. (Silk was known by the time of Solomon, but it was extremely expensive as it was produced in China and handled by numerous traders on its way west.) It would be a mistake to think of all wool at that time as being white, as <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 30:0</span> indicates quite clearly that there were also dark colored sheep and sheep that had dark and light patches, probably varying combinations of black, white, and brown.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0119_ewe_with_lamb\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>We can be fairly sure that one breed of sheep known to the Israelites was the Fat-tailed Sheep <em>Ovis laticaudata</em> and that its fatty tail is referred to in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:22; Lev 3:9; Lev 8:25; Lev 9:19</span>.","Rams’ horns had a variety of uses. Whole ram horns were used as drinking vessels, jars, and trumpets. But pieces of horn were used as handles for knives and other household implements, and for jewelry such as bracelets and beads. Needles too, and probably also arrow heads, were made from horn, as well as from bone and later from bronze and iron.","Sheep were also very important in Israelite religion.

They differ in that sheep produce wool, which is a special type of soft hair, among the ordinary hairs on their bodies. A ram’s horns too differ in shape from a goat’s horns, those of a ram curling down in a tight spiral beside its face, with those of a goat curving more gently back towards its shoulders. The sheep of biblical times produced much shorter wool than is common with wool-bearing breeds of today.","The fat-tailed or broad-tailed sheep is a smallish breed usually brown and white with a very broad tail. Like most other breeds of sheep in the Middle East it has large floppy ears.","Sheep are generally fairly timid animals, lacking the self-confidence and adaptability of goats. While goats will spread out in their search for food and then regroup without much difficulty, sheep become very insecure when they are separated from other sheep and tend to stay bunched together. They thus require a lot of shepherding. In the Middle East the method of shepherding involves training the dominant ram to follow the shepherd. The remaining sheep then follow this dominant ram, which often wears a wooden clapper or a bell. As they feed, the sheep usually keep within earshot of this sound. It is likely that this method is centuries old.

In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 13:20</span> he is referred to as “the great shepherd of the sheep” and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Pet 2:25</span> he is called “the Shepherd and Guardian of your lives\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In languages that have a word for sheep, it is advisable to translate according to the meanings given under Discussion above. If possible, the feminine forms should be translated as “female lamb” or “female sheep\". In languages in which sheep are not known, a word has usually been coined or borrowed by the time Bible translation begins, and this word should be used. It is not advisable to substitute another locally well-known animal in this case, since doing so negates the ritual and symbolic importance that sheep had for the biblical cultures.","In translating <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 23:1</span> it is extremely important to make sure that the phrase “my shepherd” preserves the relationship intended by the writer and reflects the psalmist’s theme that Yahweh is his benefactor, protector, and guide. There are really two metaphors involved in the opening verse-the caring shepherd (God) and by clear implication, the dependent sheep (the psalmist). In many languages the literal phrase “my shepherd” depicts a wrong relationship, meaning something like “the one who looks after my sheep” or “the one I employ to watch my sheep.” In many African languages unwary translators have produced a rendering that means “The Chief is (nothing more than) my herdsman.” It is often necessary to restructure the whole verse as something like “I am a sheep, and the lord is my shepherd.\""]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַיִל","transliteration":"’ayil","references":["Gen 15:9","Gen 22:13","Gen 22:13","Gen 31:38","Gen 32:15","Exod

A poor person may not have owned any cattle or goats but would generally have had sheep. In Nathan’s parable in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 12:3–2 Sam 12:6</span> the poverty of the one person is emphasized by the fact that he had only one lamb.","A wealthy person, on the other hand might own so many animals of different kinds that the herd would be divided up into flocks, each of which had its own herding personnel. In the search for grazing and water, the different flocks, all belonging to one person, would be scattered in different areas. In biblical Hebrew a combination of flocks of domestic animals can be referred to by the inclusive word <em>‘eder</em>. This word usually includes sheep, but it can also include goats, cattle, donkeys, and possibly even camels. Within a person’s <em>‘eder</em> sheep would have been the most numerous. If a writer wanted to be more specific, the groups of domestic animals within the <em>‘eder</em> could be referred to with words meaning flocks, cattle, donkeys, and camels.","This “flock” within an <em>‘eder</em> was called in Hebrew <em>ts’on</em>. This word always included sheep but could include goats too. Within the <em>ts’on</em> sheep would outnumber goats.","A <em>ts’on</em> consisted of individual animals called <em>seh</em>. While this word usually denotes sheep it can refer to goats too. In some contexts some English versions translate this word as “animal\". For instance in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 12:5</span> the Hebrew text is best translated as “It must be an animal (<em>seh</em>) without defect, a one year old male; you may choose it either from your sheep or from your goats.\""]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The text itself will often indicate the kinds of animal being referred to. In these contexts the translation is not usually difficult. However, when <em>‘eder</em> is used without indication of what animals are intended, in many languages it is best to translate this word by a phrase meaning “herds of domestic animals” or “herds of animals which people raise\".","Similarly with <em>ts’on</em>, the context often indicates whether sheep or goats are being referred to. However, where this word occurs without further clarification, it is best translated as “flocks of sheep and goats\".","The translation of <em>seh</em> is not quite so straightforward. In some contexts it is best rendered “one animal\", in others “one sheep or goat\", and in others “a sheep\". In languages in which there are different noun classes or classifiers for large and small animals, the appropriate one for an animal the size of a sheep or goat should be used when translating <em>seh</em> as “animal\"."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מַרְעִית","transliteration":"mar‘it","references":["Jer

However, there are problems connected with this rendering. The usual justifications for this translation are a) that the Akkadian equivalent word <em>rimu</em> refers to the wild ox or Aurochs <em>Bos primigenius</em>, which was frequently hunted by Akkadian kings and b) that wild ox or aurochs fits the description of the wild untameable animal referred to in the Bible.","Both of these arguments have weaknesses from a zoological point of view and the linguistic argument is also debatable. Firstly, the aurochs hunted by the Akkadian kings was an animal found in high rainfall areas with forests. In historical times it was found only in the wooded areas of central and southeastern Europe Armenia (including the southern coastland of the Black Sea) and Mesopotamia. The only aurochs remains found in the land of Israel and the Arabian Peninsula date from the early Pleistocene Age. It is highly unlikely that this animal lived in Israel in biblical times.","Secondly, while the Akkadian <em>rimu</em> is usually translated as “wild ox\", the Ugaritic <em>rum</em> has been translated by some scholars as “buffalo\", and the Old Arabic <em>rim</em> is usually translated as “oryx\". Both of these words are related to the Hebrew <em>re’em</em>. Some scholars have argued that the <em>re’em</em> is really the oryx.","Furthermore, while the wild aurochs was very large, dangerous, and strong, it was not really “untameable\". Its dependence on water made it fairly easy to capture in nets and it was domesticated very early. It is the ancestor of all short-horned European cattle. Ancient pictures carved in limestone found in the excavations at Kujunjik in Iraq show carts being pulled by cattle that look exactly the same as the aurochs pictured in hunting scenes from an earlier period.","An animal similar to the aurochs was hunted by early Egyptian kings but it had disappeared from Egypt as early as the reign of Rameses III (about 1190 B.C.), who hunted instead “wild ox” (probably the Cape buffalo) in forested areas of the Sudan, where there is no evidence that the aurochs ever lived. (A commemorative painting of one of these hunts clearly shows aurochs-like animals being hunted from chariots, but this may be artistic license or a traditional stereotype-the lions in similar paintings are certainly fanciful stereotypes.)","Among the many animal mummies found in Egypt there are a number of bubal or red hartebeest and Cape buffalo. Both of these animals fit the biblical description of “wild ox\", and the hartebeest certainly lived in Arabia and the land of Israel.","The Septuagint translates <em>re’em</em> as <em>monokerōs</em> which literally means “one-horned” (hence the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> “unicorn\") but is the ancient Greek word for rhinoceros. This translation needs to be taken seriously, because of its early date. The rhinoceros would have been an animal known to the Jews, since it was found in parts of Egypt. The ancient naturalist, Strabo of Amasia, who lived in the early part of the first century A.D., describes a rhinoceros that he saw in Egypt and refers to another naturalist of the time who had also described this animal. A variety of rhinoceros was found in Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia at the time of the Exodus, and a second variety was found in Mesopotamia.","At the time of the Exodus then, the aurochs would have been found in the forests of southeast Europe, the far north of Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia, but not in Egypt, Canaan, the Arabian Peninsula, Sinai, or Syria. However, the oryx and the bubal hartebeest would have been plentiful and well known, and the Cape buffalo and rhinoceros would have been known too, at least by hearsay.","There is another aspect of the question that needs to be kept in mind. Throughout human history large, prominent animals have had symbolic importance, even in societies that would never have seen the animal. Thus the lion has been important in Chinese and British culture for centuries, but there is no evidence that lions have ever lived in China or Britain. Thus the aurochs, while it may be a rather improbable interpretation, cannot be ruled out entirely.","Four things can be said for certain about the <em>re’em</em>.

The meaning is obviously “wolves disguised as sheep\", “wolves trying to look like sheep\", or “wolves pretending to be sheep\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 20:29</span>: In this verse Paul is speaking metaphorically.

unclean","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The basic principle in classifying animals and birds as clean or unclean was that if they ate unclean food they were themselves unclean. In cases of doubt about what they ate, they were also unclean. Thus a bird was unclean if it ate blood or meat with blood in it, garbage, unclean water creatures, or unclean insects. In addition, any bird that was associated with Egyptian or Canaanite gods, or that seemed somehow “unnatural” was also unclean.","Thus in the list of unclean birds we would expect to find eagles, vultures, and all other birds of prey such as buzzards, falcons, and hawks, scavengers like crows, kites, and seagulls, owls, storks, herons, and kingfishers, especially those that eat frogs, lizards, and snakes. Since the ibis was associated with Egyptian deities and eats worms and tadpoles, we would expect it too to be classified as unclean. Owls would be doubly unclean since they too were associated with an Egyptian god. Furthermore, knowing that ancient Israelites believed that bats, although classified as birds, were the unnatural offspring of a bird and a rat, we could expect bats also to be unclean.","However, we would not expect seed-eating or vegetarian birds to be considered unclean unless they were associated with heathen gods.","Unfortunately, in the biblical lists, there are many Hebrew words that are of very debatable meaning. Apart from a few, we are dealing only with probable rather than certain meanings. The following charts compare the lists in the various versions, omitting the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> which summarizes the twenty Hebrew words with fifteen in English. The first line in each chart gives the meaning of the word in modern Hebrew. The last line in each chart (ERH) represents the author’s own suggestion, based on a comparison of the English versions, ornithological checklists, commentaries, and other literature that discusses the linguistic derivation of the bird names. The merits of each suggestion are discussed in detail in the sections relating to the individual birds in the author’s suggested list.","In making decisions about the identity of these birds, one important factor that has been a guide is the organization of the list. The lists were obviously given to be memorized, and it is likely that they were arranged in a way that would help memorization. G. R. Driver used a similar method in his studies of these lists and was guided by what he believed was a descending order of size, so that bigger birds were mentioned before smaller ones within each general family. He decided that the three parts of the list were made up of fifteen land birds, three water birds, and two miscellaneous birds. Thus when facing a choice, he would opt for a bird smaller than the previous birds in that section of the list. However, the results of his method are sometimes very debatable, particularly as they presuppose that rather small differences between different types of owl would have been common knowledge.","The list suggested below is equally plausible in terms of the ornithology of the area, and it automatically results in a well organized list with a structure of a type found frequently in Hebrew literature, known as an “envelope.\"","Charts demonstrating the structures are given below the lists, and a discussion follows the charts.","<span class=\"image-placeholder\"

The following charts show the structures:","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table6_en\">[Image: fauna-table6_en]</span>","Each name in the list probably refers to a particular bird as representing a group of similar birds. The list begins with the two largest birds of prey, vultures and eagles. Then follows a group of three birds of prey, each of which is smaller than the previous bird on the list—the smaller bearded vulture, the kite, and all kinds of falcon or hawk. Then comes all kinds of raven or crow in a group on its own, marking a transition in the list from the birds of prey to owls.","The next group consists of two owls, with the largest owl of all, the eagle owl first, followed by the slightly smaller eared owl. Then follows the seagull, in a group on its own, marking a transition to the midpoint.","The midpoint is formed by a group of two, all kinds of (sparrow) hawk and the little owl. These represent the smallest birds of prey and the smallest owls.","Then comes the osprey on its own, paired with the seagull in the envelope structure of the list, marking a transition back to a group of two more owls, the tawny owl and the barn owl. This group corresponds to the previous group of two owls. This time, however, the smaller is mentioned first, as one would expect on this side of the midpoint.","Then comes the jackdaw (or pelican or some other owl) on its own, corresponding to the crow on its own. If the modern Hebrew <em>qa’ak</em> (jackdaw) is accepted as the equivalent of the biblical <em>qa’at</em>, (since the name is representative of the sound the bird makes, this is a strong argument), rather than “pelican” or “owl,” the correspondence to “crow” is even more marked. This pairing is also seen in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:11</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 2:14</span>. The “jackdaw” marks a transition to waterside birds, just as the crow also marked a transition.","The waterside birds are in a group of three, corresponding to the three birds of prey mentioned above. Again, the smallest is mentioned first. While the Egyptian vulture is a bird of prey, it can be found scavenging on beaches, eating eggs of many of the waterside birds. It has a beak that resembles the beaks of many large seabirds, such as the albatross, shearwater, skua, and booby. Its posture when standing is also very similar to a gull’s, and from a distance it looks just like a large gull. It possibly represents all black-and-white waterside birds, since <em>racham</em> seems to be derived from a root meaning “black and white.\"","All kinds of heron probably represents all large waterside birds with big beaks, including the ibis and the cormorant, since the word <em>’anafah</em> seems to be derived from a root meaning “nose.\"","The final group of two is a miscellaneous group consisting of the hoopoe and the bat, which is classified here as a bird.","The inclusion of the ostrich in the list in some versions is highly unlikely, since ostriches are vegetarian and classified as clean.

This group of four is matched by four birds in the corresponding group of waterside birds. The word for osprey <em>shalak</em> is here located within the group of waterside birds. The pattern of the list, however, is not as symmetrical as the Leviticus list, since there is now no word balancing the word for seagull. Finally, the order of the words for kite and falcon is reversed, as can be seen from the following chart:","<span class=\"image-placeholder\" data-id=\"fauna-table7_en\">[Image: fauna-table7_en]</span>","If we accept the majority opinion that <em>ra’ah</em> is a scribal error, and thus omit it from the list, then it would seem to be best also to return the list to its original structure as found in Leviticus, as is done in some major translations.

The Israelites were not yet a fishing people in the period of the Exodus.","In modern Hebrew <em>shalak</em> is the name given to the Osprey <em>Pandion haliaetus</em>, which is a type of fishing eagle that plunges into the water from a height and catches fish in its claws.

In modern English the words are used almost interchangeably. As a general rule, “pigeon” is used for domesticated forms of these birds, and for the larger variety of wild forms, while “dove” is used mainly for wild varieties. However, there are many exceptions to this general rule. For instance, shelters built for domestic pigeons are called “dovecotes\", and pies made from wild doves are called “pigeon pies\".","Pigeons and doves are both included in a bird family known scientifically as the <em>Colombidae</em>, consisting of well over two hundred species. In Israel and the Middle East are found the true <em>Colombidae</em>, which are easily distinguished from the genus <em>Stretopelia</em>, that is, the turtle doves.","The most common of the true <em>Colombidae</em> in the Middle East is most certainly the Asiatic Rock Dove <em>Columba livia</em>. This bird was first domesticated around 4500 B.C. in Mesopotamia. By 2500 B.C. it was kept as a domestic bird in Egypt, and by 1200 B.C. there is evidence that its homing abilities were already well known. It is this bird that is the ancestor of the domestic homing pigeons that people keep, some of which have escaped, returned to the wild, and now populate city streets all over the world. The ledges of modern buildings are a good substitute for the rock ledges that were its original nesting sites. It is likely that the Canaanites and the Israelites also kept these birds for both food and sacrifice. It is this bird that is called <em>yonah</em> in the Hebrew Bible and peristera in the Greek New Testament.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0712_pigeon\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0712_pigeon.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0712_pigeon\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>There are also three types of turtledove found in the land of Israel, two of which are resident species; the third is a migrant that arrives in spring and spends the summer in Israel.

In fact since the end of World War II in 1945 the world’s population of vultures and eagles has been reduced by over sixty percent. This is due mainly to a) calcium deficiencies as a result of eating animals in which there were high concentrations of the insecticide DDT, b) eating poisoned rats, and c) the reduction in the amount of carrion due to both the disappearance of wild animals since the invention of the modern rifle, and the modern garbage disposal systems.","<em>Nesher</em>: As is the case with many Hebrew bird names, the word <em>nesher</em> refers both to one particular bird and to a general class of birds. It seems likely that nesher refers specifically to the largest of the local birds of prey, namely the Griffon Vulture <em>Gyps fulvus</em>, but since this word also refers to large birds of prey, it also has a general reference to all or any of them. Thus this category of large birds probably also includes the Lappet-faced Vulture <em>Torgos tracheliotus negevensis</em>, (now fairly uncommon, but previously very numerous), the Golden Eagle <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>, the Imperial Eagle <em>Aquila heliaca</em>, the Steppe Eagle <em>Aquila nipalensis</em>, and possibly the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <em>Aquila verreauxii</em>. The last mentioned bird has only been breeding in modern Israel in the last thirty-five years, but some ornithologists believe that it may have lived there in ancient times, since it is associated closely with the hyrax, its favorite prey. It is not mentioned by Canon Tristram.","<em>‘Ozniyah</em>: There is considerable doubt about the meaning of this word. Its meaning is basically derived from its position in the list of unclean birds, and this makes a type of vulture more likely than the osprey. Since the Black Vulture <em>Aegypius monachus</em> is slightly smaller than the lappet-faced vulture and the bearded vulture, this seems to be the most likely candidate. It probably represents eagles and buzzards of the same size as itself, that is, some of the eagles mentioned above. In modern Hebrew <em>‘ozniyah</em> is the name for the lappet-faced and black vultures.","<em>‘Ayit</em>: There is general agreement that the word <em>‘ayit</em> in the Bible is a word that includes in its meaning both eagles and vultures. However, it probably does not include smaller birds of prey, such as the hawk, sparrow hawk, or smaller falcons. In the contexts in which it occurs it is clear that carrion-eating birds of prey are meant, rather than all birds of prey. Therefore the English expression “birds of prey” is too inclusive, but the term “carrion birds\", used in some passages in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, is probably more correct.","The word <em>‘ayit</em> is usually taken to be derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to scream\", hence “the screamer\", and is obviously a bird in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 15:11</span> and other passages. However, there are also scholars who relate <em>‘ayit</em> to a different Hebrew root meaning “to attack greedily\".","In seventeenth century English, the word “fowls” was used for large or adult birds, and “birds” was used for smaller birds or chicks. The verb “to raven” meant to tear meat off a carcass, so the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> expression “ravenous birds\"(<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 12:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 39:4</span>) did not mean “hungry birds” but rather “birds that tear meat off carcasses\".","<em>Peres</em>, a word derived from a Hebrew root meaning “to tear apart” or “to break\", probably refers to the Bearded Vulture or Lammergeir <em>Gypaëtus barbatus</em>, which looks much like an eagle. It probably represents a grouping of eagles and vultures slightly smaller than those mentioned above under nesher and would include the Black-breasted Snake Eagle (also called the Short-toed Eagle or the Black-chested Harrier Eagle) <em>Circaetus gallicus</em> (alternatively <em>Circaetus pectoralus</em>) and the Booted Eagle <em>Hieraaetus pennatus</em>, as well as one or two others.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0203_egyptian_vulture\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure><em>Racham</em> refers to something that is black and white. The position of the name in the list of unclean birds would indicate that it is a waterside bird. This narrows the choice to two possibilities, the Egyptian Vulture <em>Neophron percnopterus</em> and the Osprey <em>Pandion haliatus</em>. In modern Hebrew <em>racham</em> is the name for the Egyptian vulture, and this seems to be the bird intended by the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr> translation “white vulture\". <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> ’s “geir-eagle” is an old word for vulture.","The Egyptian vulture is smaller than the other vultures mentioned above. It has long, untidy, light orange-brown feathers on its neck and head, with a bare yellow face and yellow beak that is longer and less hooked than most vultures. The rest of the body and wings are white with black wing tips. In flight the body and the front half of the wings are white, with the wing tips and the back half of the wings black.","While this vulture does eat carrion, it is usually the scraps dropped by larger vultures, since its beak is not strong enough to tear skin and meat easily. It usually scavenges scraps on beaches or rubbish dumps and eats the eggs of ground-nesting waterside birds such as plovers, sandpipers, curlews, and others, which it breaks by knocking them with a large stone.","<em>Aetos</em>: This is the usual Greek word for any kind of eagle.","<em>Aquila</em>: This is the usual Latin word for any kind of eagle."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["True eagles have feathers on the lower part of their legs, but vultures, snake-eagles, hawks, and others usually have no such feathers.

The head, neck, and chest are gray and fawn, and its back is dark brown with darker feathers on the edges of its wings. When it is soaring, its body and the leading edges of its wings appear light brown with a broad dark band on the trailing edge of the wings. Like all true vultures, it has featherless legs.","Griffons live in fairly large groups and roost and nest together on high rock ledges, and, like most other vultures of large size, they have to wait until mid-morning when there is warm air rising up from the ground before they can fly. They then soar in spirals, going higher and higher.","They have very specialized eyes that enable them to see great distances. A proverb quoted in the Talmud says, “A vulture in Babylon sees a carcass in Israel.” They keep watch to find any dead or dying animals, and at the same time they keep track of other vultures flying nearby. They soar fairly slowly, without beating their wings. As soon as one stops spiraling and heads toward its prey, it gathers speed quickly in a shallow dive, still not beating its wings, but often reaching high speeds. The Hebrew name <em>nesher</em> may reflect the swishing sound made by its wings when it is flying this fast. Other vultures will notice this movement and will start to follow.","In African countries where both griffon and lappet-faced vultures live, griffons usually arrive at a carcass in fairly large numbers, with the lappet-faced vultures arriving in pairs. Often a dead cow will attract twenty griffons or more and perhaps four lappet-faced vultures. It is likely that this ratio was the case in ancient Israel too.","The griffons attack the stomach and other soft parts of the carcass and thrust their heads deep into the body to eat the liver and other soft organs before starting on the softer meat, eating “from the inside out.” They eat very quickly and can consume a kilogram (2 pounds) of meat in about two minutes. After gorging themselves it is difficult for them to fly, and they need to run and hop along the ground before getting airborne. If there is no obvious danger, they prefer to remain on the ground or to perch on logs or in nearby trees after eating.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0577_lappet-faced_vulture\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure><strong>Lappet-faced vulture</strong>: This vulture is almost as big as the griffon in terms of height and wingspan but has a lighter build. They live singly or in pairs in the Negev and roost and nest in the tops of flat-topped trees such as acacias.

The head, face, and neck are covered with bare red skin. The head and neck have thick wrinkles. The rest of the body is dark brown or black with white thighs and shoulders. When they are soaring they appear to be uniformly black except for a thin white streak on the leading edge of the wings, with the white thighs (usually referred to by bird watchers as their “white pants\") clearly visible.","At a carcass they feed “from the outside in,” tearing the skin and eating it before starting on the meat. Lappet-faced vultures are very aggressive and dominate the griffons at a carcass they are sharing. Although carrion is their main food, they also sometimes kill their own prey, mainly small mammals such as young gazelles or hares.","<strong>Black vulture</strong>: The black vulture, as its name suggests, is black all over apart from the bare head and neck, which are a bluish gray. When viewed from below it appears completely black.","<strong>Large eagles</strong>: The golden, imperial, and Verreaux’s eagles mentioned above are all very large and have a wingspan of at least 2 meters (6 feet). They are not mainly scavengers, but may occasionally join vultures at a carcass.

Here the context will determine the choice.","Care should be taken in those contexts where the nest is referred to as high on a cliff face, since some species of vulture and eagle nest in trees. In these cases a cliff-nesting alternative should be chosen, even if it is a smaller bird of prey.","<em>‘Ozniyah</em> is probably a word for the black vulture or a type of medium-sized eagle. An expression meaning “small vulture” is probably the best equivalent.","Another name for an eagle or vulture of similar size as the black vulture can be used in the lists of unclean birds for <em>‘ozniyah</em>, or it can be included, along with <em>peres</em>, in a general expression covering both fairly large vultures and eagles.","<em>‘Ayit</em> In languages that do not have a single word including both eagles and vultures, but where both types of bird are found, such as in Africa and the Middle East, it is better to use a simple phrase meaning “eagles and vultures.” A phrase such as “scavenging birds of prey,” or simply “vultures,” could also be used.","True vultures are not found in the Americas or Australasia, but a word for “buzzards,” or, in the case of the Americas, “condors” can substitute for “vultures.” Elsewhere a phrase such as “eagles that eat dead things” or a borrowed word can be used.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 12:9</span>: The phrase <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> in this verse is taken by some scholars to mean “speckled bird of prey.” Others take <em>tsavu‘a</em> to mean “hyena” and (taking <em>‘ayit</em> to be derived from a root meaning “attack greedily\") they interpret <em>‘ayit tsavu‘a</em> to mean either “greedy/scavenging hyenas,” “prey for hyenas,” or “carrion for hyenas.” These latter interpretations make better sense in the context than “speckled bird of prey.” See <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:2.19\">2.19 Hyena</a>.","Translators may at times need to keep local cultural conditioning in mind. In some cultures vultures and eagles carry very different associations in popular thought, the one being considered nasty, dirty, and generally negative, while the other is a symbol of power and nobility. While the latter symbolism is found in Scripture, it is usually associated with the <em>nesher</em>, which most commonly indicates the vulture rather than the eagle. So, for example, one might translate as “I carried you on the wings of vultures” (see the discussion below). However, this would evoke a wrong response from most Western readers. Where such symbolism exists and where the context allows, it will be preferable to render “eagle\".","<em>Peres</em>: The bearded vulture is found in the mountainous regions of southern Europe, Central and South Asia, and eastern and southern Africa. The medium-sized short-toed eagle is found throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The booted eagle is found all over Europe, Asia, and Africa. Elsewhere, the name for a medium-sized vulture or eagle can be used to translate <em>peres</em>.","In Africa there are many vultures closely related to the griffon vulture, and the lappet-faced vulture is common in most areas of the African continent. The African griffons include the White-backed Vulture <em>Gyps africanus</em> (alternately <em>Gyps bengalensis</em>), which nests in trees, the Cape Vulture <em>Gyps coprotheres</em>, and Ruppell’s Vulture <em>Gyps ruppelli</em>. The local word for any of these would be a good equivalent in contexts where the text refers to vultures.","Griffons are also found in central and eastern Europe and on the Indian sub-continent. The condors of Latin America and California would be local equivalents. The Wedge-tailed Eagle <em>Aquila audax</em> of Australia would be an equivalent there.","Golden and imperial eagles are found in most of western Europe as well as Israel.","African equivalents of the golden and imperial eagles would be the Black or Verreaux’s Eagle <em>Aquila verreauxii</em> and the Martial Eagle <em>Polemaetus bellicosus</em>.","The Steppe Eagle <em>Aquila nipalensis migrates</em> across Israel to as far south as the northern parts of South Africa. It is also found in eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and South Asia.","In North America the Bald Eagle <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em> would be an equivalent in some contexts of the Hebrew <em>nesher</em>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 19:4</span>: The expression “I carried you on eagles’ wings” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) involves a metaphor that has been taken literally by readers in many languages. However, the text does not mean that eagles carried the Israelites to Sinai. Rather the metaphor refers to God’s protection, speed, and power and means “I brought you here as if I had been a flying eagle carrying you.\"","Some commentaries have quoted an often repeated but unsubstantiated statement to the effect that the Israelites believed that eagles carry their young on their wings. Some commentaries have even claimed that naturalists have actually seen eagles doing this. There is no independent evidence for this belief apart from two biblical passages of which this is one, and none of the naturalists who have specialized in the observation of eagles has ever reported this kind of behavior. These commentaries have actually misinterpreted the Hebrew idiom “on wings,” which does not mean “on the upper surface of the wings” but rather “in flight.\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 28:49</span>: Since the context indicates that the <em>nesher</em> in this verse is attacking the disobedient nation of Israel rather than devouring the dead nation, the word should be interpreted as a large eagle (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) rather than as a vulture (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 32:10; Deut 32:11; Deut 32:12</span>: There are a number of problems in verse 11. In the Hebrew poem verses 10 and 11 are closely linked, so that the main thought of verse 10 is continued in verse 11. In verse 10 the last three verbs are “shielded or, encircled, cared for, guarded.” In this context the translation of verse 11 as “stirs up its nest” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) is not likely. “Watches over its nest” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) is a better exegesis, but this verb is often translated elsewhere as encourage so “encourages its nestlings” is entirely possible (see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>).","All of the English versions misrepresent how an eagle teaches its young to fly, probably because they accept the hypothetical myth mentioned above, namely that eagles carry their young on their wings.","What actually happens is that young eagles are shown by their parents how to set their wings by spreading them when the wind blows, while holding on to the side of the nest. Eventually when the young eagles have mastered this, they let go and ride the wind out of the nest. At this stage the parent eagles are usually nearby, circling overhead.","The Hebrew text, if the myth hypothesis is rejected, is actually open to a very different interpretation that is in accordance with what really happens. This interpretation has some scholarly support, but has not yet been mentioned in any commentary or translation. It involves interpreting the last verb in verse 11 as meaning “lifts himself up” rather than “is lifted up.” The following model gives this interpretation:","10He found him in a desert land,","in a barren howling waste.","He circled around him, cared for him,","guarded him like the apple of his eye.","11Like an eagle encouraging its nestling,","hovering over its offspring,","spreading its wings, instructing him,","until he rises up on his strong wings,","12Yahweh alone guided Israel,","with no foreign god at his side.","In verse 11 there are two words for “wing\", the second of which is a poetic word derived from a Hebrew root meaning “mighty\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 4:33</span>: The reference here to Nebuchadnezzar’s hair growing “as long as an eagle’s feathers” may seem a strange one, since the eagles indigenous to the land of Israel have rather neat-looking heads, and the large vultures have either short bristles on their heads or are bald. The comparison may be to the small Egyptian vulture, which has very untidy long feathers on its head and neck, or perhaps to the Long-crested Eagle <em>Lophaetus occipitalis</em>, which is very common all over eastern and southern Africa, as far north as Ethiopia and Sudan.","In those parts of Africa where the Egyptian vulture or the long-crested eagle are known, the name for either one would fit this context well.

Since the word is not a common one, it is only the contexts of these two verses that provide clues to its meaning. It is the Isaiah passage that gives the most contextual clues, but even there, there are some words with very obscure meaning. Most commentaries and translations agree about the first two verbs but about little else in the verse. If we transliterate rather than translate the disputed Hebrew words in , a fairly literal translation of the first half of the verse reads:","There a <em>qipoz</em> will nest, will lay eggs, will break open, and <em>dagrah</em> under her shadow.","All English versions translate <em>bak‘ah</em> (\"break open\") as “hatch them\", and this leads some to translate <em>dagrah</em> as “gather her brood\". However, it should be noted that this interpretation involves a change of implied object from “eggs” to “chicks” or “brood\".","If the translation of <em>dagar</em> were done consistently, one would expect that the Jeremiah passage would be translated:","a) As a partridge cares for/gathers chicks it did not hatch . . . .","Only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> in fact do this. In place of this most of the others have:","b) Like a partridge that sits on eggs (\"hatches” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>) it did not lay . . . .","Most versions thus translate <em>dagar</em> in two different ways even though the contexts of both passages seem very similar.","The Hebrew word <em>yalad</em> is a much more common word, and in other contexts it means “give birth to” or “bring forth\". <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span> is the only place where this verb is used with a bird. This would seem to indicate two possible translations of the verb in this verse. The first is “lay eggs\". This is what leads to interpretation b) above and to the two very different interpretations being given for <em>dagar</em> in what are basically identical contexts. However, the noun form <em>yeled</em>, when used of birds, does not refer to their eggs but to their chicks (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 38:41</span>), and this would justify the second possible translation, namely “to hatch chicks\".","Interpretation b) is supported by Jewish Midrashic traditions and by most commentaries and Bible dictionaries. These sources usually contain a reference to “a popular but incorrect belief that partridges steal eggs from other birds.” However, in the course of the research for this Handbook, this assumption was found to be very dubious. Many scholars now question its validity. The major problem with the traditional interpretation is that the only supporting evidence for the “popular but erroneous belief” is this one possible translation of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>. The argument is thus circular: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span> must be interpreted in the light of a myth; the source for the myth is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>.","In trying to provide some hypothetical basis for the “popular but erroneous belief,” reference is made to the fact that most partridges indigenous to the land lay twelve or more eggs in a clutch, and this might have led to the belief that partridges collect eggs from each other. However, as mentioned above, there is no independent evidence at all for such a belief. Partridges and their eggs were, and are, a regular and important food source, and it is hard to believe that the ancient prophets did not know where the eggs came from.","There are three possible alternative interpretations of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 17:11</span>, none of which corresponds to interpretation b) above.","The first alternative results from an interpretation of <em>dagar</em> as meaning “to sit in a broody state while incubating eggs.” This is the meaning given as a gloss in Abraham Even-Shoshan’s <em>A New Concordance of the Old Testament</em>. <em>Yalad</em> is taken to mean “lay eggs\". The verse can then be translated:","c) “Like a partridge that sits brooding but has not laid eggs ....\"","This could then be taken as a reference to the habit partridges have of sitting motionless in the shade, or as one of their means of defence. In situations of danger from eagles or hawks, they make use of their fantastic camouflage and sit absolutely still for long periods in what is almost a state of trance. When sitting like this one can approach to within a few feet of the bird. The point of the simile would be that the man who has become rich by unjust means is like a partridge that only <em>appears</em> to be productive. No commentator that I know of has raised this possible interpretation, probably because it is difficult to relate to the last half of the verse, which is literally “they will leave him half-way through his life.\"","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 34:15</span> the last phrase would then be translated as “sits brooding in the shade.” (In response to the suggestion that the Hebrew should be altered to read <em>betseyha</em> “her eggs” instead of <em>betsilah</em> “in/under her shade\", it has been pointed out by many scholars that the sequence of verbs which then results is improbable. The existing text yields “makes a nest ... lays ... hatches ... sits brooding her eggs.\")","The second possible alternative interpretation follows the same understanding of <em>dagar</em>, but <em>yalad</em> is taken to mean “hatch chicks\":","d) “Like a partridge that sits brooding on eggs but does not get to hatch them ....\"","This would refer to the fact that a large percentage of the numerous eggs that a partridge lays were, and are, collected by people or stolen by other animals such as jackals and mongooses, birds such as crows, or monitor lizards. It is interesting that Canon Tristram mentions finding a partridge nest containing twenty-eight eggs, and that a particular Bedouin camp he was associated with collected over eight hundred partridge eggs in a single breeding season. The collecting of eggs is mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:14</span>, and it is likely that partridge eggs were the most common and easiest to find.","Rendering d) is the interpretation adopted by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>. The point of the comparison would then seem to be that getting rich by dishonest means is as futile as a partridge laying eggs that others steal. The inference seems to be that ill-gotten wealth will be taken away, either by the authorities or perhaps by God. This is the interpretation preferred by a growing number of scholars.

(This is not true of some of the other partridge species). Rock partridge hens can be seen caring for as many as fifty chicks at a time. As the chicks grow, their ties with the hens weaken considerably, and when the expanding flock divides up into smaller flocks the offspring often move away.

Snakes</strong>","There are at least forty snake species found in the Middle East and adjacent areas of Africa. Some are small, being only about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, while others may reach 2 meters (6 feet) in length. They live in a variety of habitats, from desert sand to rocky wadis, thick undergrowth, and river banks, with different species preferring their own type of environment. The snakes of this region include representative species of all of the major snake families except the rattlesnake.","Many of these Middle Eastern snake species are non-poisonous, but the biblical writers, in common with many other peoples around the world, had the traditional belief that all were poisonous. In fact this region has a higher proportion of poisonous species than most other areas of the world. Like many other people too, the Jews and early Christians had a great fear of snakes of all kinds. Thus there is no reference in the Bible to harmless snakes.","It is unlikely that the biblical writers would have differentiated between many of the individual species. It is more likely that they only made a distinction between the types of snake that were most common. There were, of course, also general words that included all types.","Some scholars claim that the ancient biblical writers believed that when a snake bit someone, the snake’s tongue stung him at the same time, and that it was this sting that poisoned the man. Others, however, believe that while the poison was certainly associated with the snake’s tongue, the verb “sting” was in fact just the Hebrew way of referring to the rather special way a snake bites. This would be supported by the fact that in many languages around the world the word for a snake’s bite is different from the usual word “bite\". In these languages the words used are equivalent to “peck\", “stab\", “burn\", “sting\", and such like.","In fact, as most readers will know, snake poison is produced not by the tongue but by glands situated between the snake’s mouth and its eyes, and the poison is conveyed through tube-like vessels to the fangs, which are hollow in some species and deeply grooved in others. When the snake bites, muscles force the liquid poison from the glands into the fangs, thus injecting the poison into the victim.","All snakes are carnivorous, with some small species eating insects and worms, while the rest may eat frogs, mice, birds and bird eggs, lizards, and other snakes. Without exception this food is swallowed whole. The snake is able to dislocate its jaw, making it possible to open the jaw very wide, and the muscles and skin around the neck are flexible enough to allow the prey to pass. However, snakes eat only very seldom, and some larger snakes are known to have gone many months without food. Even those that eat more frequently do so only every three or four days.","All snakes lay eggs, but in the case of vipers the eggs are kept inside the female until they hatch. There are thus snakes that appear to give birth to live young, as well as those that lay clutches of eggs.","Snake charming has a very long history and was well known in Bible times. The snake usually chosen for this purpose was the Egyptian cobra, which is a large snake with the ability to spread its neck into a flat hood when it adopts the upright threatening posture typical of the cobra family. It also has striking markings on the hood. The charmer uses a flute-like musical instrument that he plays. The snake begins to emerge from a basket or clay pot and is then hypnotized by the charmer, and begins to mimic the charmer’s movements. It was believed that it was the charmer’s magical music that produced this effect. Modern experiments have shown that the cobra is actually deaf but is sensitive to the vibrations produced by the music. However, it is not the music alone which produces the trance, but the swaying motions that the charmer makes with the flute.","The various Hebrew words for snake all contain sounds similar to the puffs and hisses made by snakes. This makes it difficult to associate a name with a particular species. However, with some of the names that occur repeatedly, the contexts help somewhat to make a tentative identification of the type of snake.","<strong>B. Lizards</strong>","There are at least forty species and subspecies of lizard found in the land of Israel, and the Hebrew words, rather than differentiating between them all, seem to make distinctions only between the more obvious main groups of species. Most of these names occur only once, in the list of unclean foods in Leviticus, so identification is only very speculative. In spite of this, however, there is some agreement among scholars about the types of lizard mentioned. This is because the Hebrew words are fairly descriptive, and one can identify a type of lizard with the descriptive name in many cases.","Rather than trying to list the different kinds, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> sums up the whole list in as “lizards\".

It belongs to the category of snakes called constrictors, which coil around their prey and suffocate them by crushing the breath out of them. It lives in the sand and among rocks, rather than in trees, and is slow-moving. It reaches about 75 centimeters (30 inches) in length.

The Palestinian viper is the largest of these vipers and is found in a variety of habitats, from the woods of the north to the desert’s edge. Since this is the most inhabited area, people are bitten by this snake more than any other. The other four vipers mentioned are found in desert areas, but in slightly different habitats. The sand viper and the horned viper live in the sand, while the carpet viper lives in gravelly areas and among rocks. It often camouflages itself among dried leaves.","The desert vipers, when moving in sand, cannot move in the normal way, so they adopt a movement known as “sidewinding\". They do this by moving a coil sideways to a position in front of the head, then the snake moves its head and the front part of its body in the air, arching over the sand as far as it can reach before falling back onto the sand. Then it repeats the movement again. This is done at some speed, and the snake moves diagonally across the sand surprisingly quickly, although not as quickly as another snake moving normally. The parallel elongated S-shaped marks it leaves in the sand look as though it has moved in a series of jumps, since they seem not to be connected. It is generally accepted that this motion caused the biblical writers to refer to these snakes as “flying\"."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Vipers are different from other snakes mainly in that they give birth to live offspring. The females retain their eggs in a special sac in their bodies, and when the eggs hatch the small snakes emerge from the mother. The larger vipers produce as many as sixty young snakes at a time, while the smaller sand vipers have smaller broods of about twelve to fifteen. This is what John the Baptist refers to by his well-known phrase “brood of vipers\".","The vipers have long hinged fangs located in the front of their mouths. These fangs fold back as they close their mouths. When striking, vipers have to open their mouths very wide in order to get these fangs into the required position.","The carpet viper (also known as the saw-scaled viper) was very numerous in biblical Israel, and in most other areas of its range (it is found in a broad continuous band from West Africa to South and Central Asia). It is likely that this was the <em>saraf</em>, a name derived from a finite verb meaning “to burn something,” a reference to the burning effect of its poisonous bite.","This snake occurs in two slightly different forms. The most common type in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula is a reddish brown snake with a pale underside. It has a row of pale blotches arranged side-by-side in pairs all the way down its back. These blotches give it excellent camouflage. It grows to about 80 centimeters (32 inches) in length, and its head is smaller and its body thinner than most typical vipers. It is very easily provoked and quite an aggressive snake. It is mainly active in the daytime, as it can stand higher temperatures than many other snakes. It lives in desert and grassland areas and feeds on jerboas, mice, and mole rats. Its venom, like that of most vipers, is highly poisonous, attacking both the blood vessels and the blood corpuscles, but, like the poison of most other vipers, it is slow-acting.","Carpet vipers move like other snakes on firm surfaces, but in sand they move by side-winding.","The horned viper is one of the two common sand vipers found in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. As the species name suggests, these vipers live in sand. They have scales arranged so that with small sideways movements they can bury themselves in the sand, with only their eyes and nostrils showing. This is how they lie in wait for their prey, mainly jerboas and other small rodents. When the sand gets too hot for comfort, they bury themselves even deeper, or they move to the shade of a stone.","The horned viper has an unusually elongated scale above each eye, the “horns\". It is a light brown mottled color and moves by sidewinding. It has a broad head and grows to a length of about 75 centimeters (30 inches).","The sand viper is similar in habits to the horned viper, but it is slightly smaller, reaching about 35 centimeters (14 inches) in length in Israel.

It grows to about 1.25 meters (4 feet) in length, and may be 100 millimeters (4 inches) thick. It is a beautifully marked snake, basically a light brown, with a dark brown zigzag stripe with a pale border down the middle of its back. It also has dark brown blotches with pale borders on each side of the zigzag stripe. Its head is striped.","This snake feeds on mice, toads, and frogs and is often found close to human dwellings.

In southern Africa the Puff Adder <em>Bitis arietans</em> is probably the best equivalent.","In order to retain the relationship of the word <em>saraf</em> with the verb “to burn something,” translators often try to use expressions such as “vipers that burn [people]” or “fiery serpents\". This is only possible where the word used for “burn” means “to cause a wound with something hot.” One should not convey the idea of “a viper that sets people on fire” or “a viper that is burning.” Often it is better to use a phrase meaning simply “poisonous vipers\".","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:17</span>: Some commentaries have identified this snake as one of the sand vipers, since these conceal themselves so well that the horse may not see the snake and so be bitten on the heel.

A literal translation of the Hebrew is:","They hatch cobras’ eggs, they spin spiders’ webs,","The one who eats their eggs dies,","The one who/which is pressed, a viper is hatched/born.","The problem in interpretation centers around the subject of the first passive clause. Who or what is squashed, squeezed, or pressed? Many commentators take the subject to be the egg, but a few take it to mean the evil people (compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>: “if one of them is pressed, it will hatch as a viper\"). If the first interpretation is followed, then the poem would read:","They hatch cobras’ eggs and spin spiders’ web.","Whoever eats their eggs dies,","And if one of their eggs is squashed a viper breaks out.","However, many have pointed out that it makes little sense to say a viper emerges from a cobra’s egg. The poetry would be making no new point at all.

This is probably due to two main factors: a) the Hebrews as nomadic shepherds probably did not eat fish regularly until their sojourn in Egypt; and b) they were afraid of the sea, and thus probably did not get involved in commercial fishing until late in their history. Nevertheless, in Egypt in particular, fish would have been a regular item of the diet. The Nile River was full of good-eating fish, such as Nile perch, tilapia, and giant catfish, although this latter fish would not have been eaten by the Hebrews as it does not have obvious scales.","However, there is ample reference to the fact that after the Exodus from Egypt the people of Israel did eat fish, and different types of fishnets, fishing spears, and hooks are also referred to. Archeological finds indicate that the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians bred fish in ponds, and it is possible that the Israelites did the same. Most of the commercial fishing was done by the Philistines and other Phoenician peoples. One of the Philistine goddesses, Atargatis, whose cult began in Syria, was a fish-goddess.","Fishing in Lake Galilee does not seem to have been a Jewish activity until the Maccabean period. Until this period it seems that the Jews fished in rivers and streams and perhaps kept fish in ponds, but they bought dried fish from coastal peoples.","The Hebrew words <em>dag</em> and <em>dagah</em> are general terms and do not refer to any particular species. Marine fish found in the eastern Mediterranean Sea are not abundant, due to the fact that the sea in this region is poor in nutrients. The only fish likely to be caught in any numbers in nets in this region are sardines and mullet. There are tropical reef fish in those few inshore places where the reefs are shallow, and some line fishing may have been done for these species.","The Greek word <em>ichthus</em> and the Latin <em>piscis</em> are likewise general words for fish. However, <em>ichthudion</em> (literally “little fish\") is probably a reference to the Lake or Holy Land Sardine (sometimes called Bleak) <em>Mirogrex terrae sanctae</em>, which is abundant in Lake Galilee and has been fished for centuries. This is a small freshwater sardine similar to the <em>kapenta</em> found in the great lakes of Africa. Tilapia are also abundant in Lake Galilee.","The word <em>enalion</em> includes fish in its meaning but refers to all sea creatures, including crustaceans and dolphins. The word <em>opsarion</em> refers to cooked fish or fish about to be cooked and eaten. In the context of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 21:5</span> <em>prosfagion</em> refers to fish for breakfast.

Some of the insects that have been suggested are discussed below:","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0643_mosquito\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0643_mosquito.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0643_mosquito\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure><strong>Gnat/Mosquito</strong>: “Gnat” is a fairly archaic word for a number of species of small flying insects, such as mosquitoes, lake flies, and the minute flies also known as “midges\". These all abound naturally in Egypt, especially in the Nile Valley. Thus the pest referred to by the Hebrew <em>ken</em> is likely mosquitoes that bite humans, in this case the Malaria Mosquito <em>Anopheles</em>. This identification was supported by Hort, who pointed out that once the Egyptian frogs had all died, mosquitoes and flies were bound to multiply in unprecedented numbers.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0628_midges\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0628_midges.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0628_midges\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Mosquitoes are small flying insects that make a characteristic whining noise as they fly. They are found wherever there is stagnant water and vegetation. Some species are active in the daytime, and others at night. They lay eggs on the surface of pools and puddles or in damp vegetation. The eggs hatch as small worm-like creatures called nymphs, which have hair-like tails through which they breathe. Most species of nymph live in water, but they must rise to the surface to breathe. When they mature, they emerge from the water and wait for their new wings to dry before they fly off to feed. Females of many species feed on human or animal blood, and some species can transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0609_louse\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0609_louse.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0609_louse\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure><strong>Louse</strong>: This tiny wingless insect belongs to a family with the scientific name <em>Siphunculata (Anoplura)</em>. They are generally tiny, whitish creatures that live on humans, animals, or birds and feed by sucking blood from the skin. The Human Body Louse <em>Pediculus humanus</em> is usually found on the head and hairy parts of the body. Lice crawl around, but they do not jump like fleas. They are extremely common in crowded conditions, because they pass easily from one person to another. They lay small eggs attached to the hairs of the unknowing host.","Lice breed in dirt, and since the water in the first plague had “turned to blood,” the Egyptians probably did not bathe for some time. Conditions were probably dirtier than usual. Lice are also the carriers of the killer disease typhus. However, as a counter argument to the suggestion that <em>ken</em> are lice, some scholars have pointed out that the biblical text indicates that the <em>kinim</em> attacked man and beast, and lice are not normally a serious threat to livestock, but only a nuisance.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> translation “lice” has the support of the eminent zoological archaeologist F.S. Bodenheimer, as well as rabbinical tradition and ancient commentators such as Josephus.","<strong>Maggot</strong>: The maggots found in many tropical countries are the larvae of various species of fly. The fly lays its eggs in clothing or in wounds on the skin. The eggs quickly hatch out as minute worms that burrow into the surrounding flesh, on which they feed. As they grow larger they form lumps like boils under the skin. The mature larvae then emerge, leaving open sores. These maggots are thus associated with flies on the one hand and with boils on the other. It seems significant that two of the following three plagues in Egypt were in fact flies and boils. This logical possibility is the main support for the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> rendering. See also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FAUNA:6.13\">6.13 Worm, maggot</a>.","<strong>Ticks</strong> are small eight-legged creatures belonging to a class called <em>Arachnida</em>, which also includes spiders and scorpions. However, ticks are much smaller than the other members of the class and do not look like spiders or scorpions. They attach themselves very firmly to the skin of a person, animal, reptile, or bird and begin to suck blood (compare the meaning “attached firmly” which some scholars suggest as the root from which <em>ken</em> is derived). The females become so bloated that they swell to almost one hundred times their original size and then drop off and lay many eggs in the soil. When these eggs hatch, hundreds of baby ticks emerge and settle into the dust or attach themselves to grass stems. They are able to exist like this for many months, just waiting for a suitable person, animal, or bird to pass by. Once they are able to get onto the creature they were waiting for, they crawl around until they sense a blood vessel close to the surface. Then they bite into the skin and begin to feed. The places where they have begun to feed become very itchy and may turn into sores.","Ticks are a common pest in Egypt and many other subtropical and tropical countries. They carry diseases that can be dangerous to man, such as tropical tick fever (also known as relapsing fever), or dangerous to animals, such as Texas cattle fever and distemper.

The lower portion of these legs has a row of spikes that are used both for making sounds and as a means of defense. The front wings are narrow, straight, and stiff. When not being used to fly, they function as a cover for thin, membrane-like hind wings, which are much larger and colored, and which are folded together like a Chinese fan. When the locust or grasshopper flies, it hops into the air spreading out its wings as it does so. It flies with a slight clattering sound, made by the stiff front wings striking each other.","Locusts differ from grasshoppers mainly in that they form swarms at certain periods and migrate to new areas, which they colonize. At other times they live either solitary or in small groups. Their reproduction rate varies with the climatic conditions. Eggs are laid in the soil in small packets, and hatching is related to the degree of humidity. In dry periods only a few hatch, but in periods of good rainfall they suddenly hatch out in exceptionally large numbers.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0607_locusts\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0607_locusts.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0607_locusts\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Unlike most other insects, locusts do not go through stages in which they exist as larvae or caterpillars. They emerge from the eggs as nymphs, which are simply tiny wingless locusts with undeveloped hopper legs. The nymphs, which can only crawl around, feed on green vegetation, consuming many times their own body weight each day. As they grow bigger and develop, they shed their skins. Their hopping legs develop before their wings, so that they pass through a stage when they can hop but not fly. At this stage, when they are referred to as “hoppers\", they exist in less dense masses than as nymphs, having spread out a little, but since they are now eating even more than before, they can still cause considerable damage to crops. Once they develop into adults they can both hop and fly. If the climatic conditions are right and exceptionally large numbers have developed to this stage, they completely devastate the vegetation where they have been developing. When this happens they begin to congregate in preparation for swarming. In other words they come together and migrate as a group to greener pastures, flying together in large swarms. At this congregating stage, during the migration and immediately after it, they present a major threat to crops and other vegetation, on which they feed unceasingly.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0608_locust_swarm\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0608_locust_swarm.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0608_locust_swarm\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>A locust swarm may consist of billions of locusts. G.S. Cansdale quotes a report of a single swarm in 1889 that was estimated to cover 5,500 square kilometers (about 2,000 square miles). Certainly even in recent times swarms have been known large enough to blot out the sun like a large black cloud. The clattering of wings as the locusts approach is a sound hard to forget. Where the swarm lands, even temporarily, every green bush or clump of grass in sight is attacked by the locusts, and the sound of them munching on the leaves is clearly audible, sometimes for hours. Afterwards, hardly a single green leaf or blade of grass can be seen, and many bushes even have the bark eaten off, leaving them bare.","Against such enormous numbers ancient peoples felt absolutely helpless. There was no way they could stop the destruction. The lighting of grass fires helped only in a very small way. Ironically it is when locusts swarm like this that they can be easily caught in large numbers for eating. They are often caught in blankets, fishing nets, and baskets. The lower part of the hopping legs is snapped off, and they are cooked by toasting, grilling, frying, or broiling. In some places they are also eaten raw. When toasted and salted they taste a little like salted peanuts.","Some commentators have pointed out that the plague of locusts in Egypt probably provided the Israelites with food in the Arabian and Sinai deserts, since this is the usual migration route of locusts in that part of the world.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0606_locust\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0606_locust.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0606_locust\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Following is a summary of the development cycle of the major locust species: Nymphs, which can only crawl, develop to a hopping stage; the hoppers develop wings and become adult locusts; if climatic conditions are right, these adults gather into swarms and migrate to new locations; the females lay eggs, and the whole cycle is repeated. There are thus four discernible phases: nymphs, hoppers, resident adults, and swarming or migrating adults. It is possible that <em>chasil</em> refers to the crawling nymph, <em>yeleq</em> to the juvenile hopper, <em>’arbeh</em> to the resident adult, and <em>gazam</em> to the swarming adult. However, this is far from proven, as the words seem to be used almost interchangeably when referring to locust plagues.","<strong>Crickets and katydids</strong>: Crickets are a wingless, nocturnal relative of the locusts and grasshoppers. They are usually black or brown, with shorter rounder bodies, and they shelter during the day under rocks or logs, or, in the case of the so-called mole crickets, in holes that they dig. At night they make characteristic high-pitched chirping sounds, which carry a surprisingly long way. Each species makes a slightly different sound. Like locusts and grasshoppers they feed on vegetation, usually leaves.","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0564_katydid\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0564_katydid.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0564_katydid\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Katydids are similar to crickets but are usually green and have wings.

In these areas it should be easy to find a local word. However, in some countries with high rainfall this and other species of locust do not swarm in the same way that they do in the Middle East and the drier parts of Africa. In these countries it may be necessary in some contexts to use a phrase such as “swarms of locusts” rather than simply “locusts\". In areas where locusts are not known, a phrase like “large/giant grasshopper” can usually be substituted.","The Hebrew words <em>gev, gov</em> and <em>govay</em> are related to a verb meaning “to swarm” or “to gather together\", and thus the reference is almost certainly to the locust.","The word <em>tselatsal</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 28:42; Isa 18:1</span>) represents the sound of insects’ wings, and the reference is most likely to the sound made by a swarm of locusts. The English versions that have “whirring” or “buzzing” make some attempt at reflecting this, but “buzzing” is inadequate as a description of the sound such a swarm makes. “Clattering\", “chirping\", “whirring\", or “fluttering” comes closest in English to representing the sound represented by the Hebrew word.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> are alone in interpreting this word to refer to the “mole cricket\", an insect that at worst creates a minor nuisance, not a plague of the proportions of a locust swarm. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 18:1</span> both of these versions follow the Septuagint rather than the Masoretic Text, and translate “sailing ships\".","Translations that represent a) locust swarms and b) the sound such swarms make are recommended. In English this would be something like “whirring locust swarms” in both the Deuteronomy and Isaiah passages. In many Bantu languages in Africa, and in other languages where ideophones occur which express the sound of thousands of whirring wings, such ideophones are a good equivalent. Elsewhere a noun phrase, modified by an adverbial expression similar to the English, can be used.","In most contexts the word <em>chagav</em> seems to mean “grasshopper\", the exception being <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 7:13</span>, where the reference is to locusts. In the two passages where the grasshopper symbolizes something small and insignificant (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 13:33</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:22</span>), it may not be possible to capture the right inference by translating literally. In such cases the translator is free to use some other insect that is symbolic of small size and insignificance in the local culture, such as “ant\", “louse\", “flea\", and others. In cases where no insect name carries this symbolism, the name of an animal with the correct connotations can be used; for example, “mouse” or “squirrel\".","In verses where only one Hebrew word for “locust” occurs, there is little problem, and the word for “grasshopper” or “locust” in the local language can be used. The following notes refer to cases where more than one of these words occur:","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:22</span>: This text contains four clean insects. The two Hebrew words <em>sol‘am</em> and <em>chargol</em> occur only here, so it is very difficult to be precise about their meaning. The suggestions, therefore, have to be very tentative.","From the general rule given in this verse about the characteristics of clean insects, we can deduce that all four of the insects have specialized legs for hopping. This would suggest that locusts (<em>’arbeh</em>), grasshoppers (<em>chagav</em>), and crickets (probably <em>chargol</em>) would be included in the list, as various species of these three insects are commonly eaten in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. Since a fourth name occurs in the list, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> translates <em>sol‘am</em> as “katydid\", while <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translates <em>chargol</em> as “katydids” and <em>sol‘am</em> as “grasshoppers\". The katydid is a nocturnal hopping insect similar to a grasshopper in many respects, but usually with green leaf-shaped wings. However, katydids are usually solitary creatures, and not very easy to collect, and thus they are not commonly a food source. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and possibly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> take <em>sol‘am</em> to be a type of locust, so that their lists contain two types of locust, plus grasshoppers and crickets.","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> opt rather for four different kinds of locust, which they refer to as the “great locust” (<em>’arbeh</em>), the “long-headed locust” (<em>sol‘am</em>), the “green locust” (<em>chargol</em>), and the “desert locust” (<em>chagav</em>). These identifications are based on the supposed etymology of the words, that is, the ancient Semitic roots from which the Hebrew words are derived. However, etymology is a very dubious basis for ascribing meaning to words, and these particular derivations have little support in the scholarly world. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> translates <em>chagav</em> as “cricket\".","All that can be said with certainty about the list of clean insects is that it most probably contains locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets. It is probably safest to translate the list as “all kinds of locusts, all kinds of grasshoppers, and all kinds of crickets,” and add this footnote: “In Hebrew there are four insects in the list. Some scholars suggest that these are four different types of locust.\"","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 8:37; 2 Chr 6:28</span>: The Hebrew in these verses has both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>chasil</em> in a list of calamities. The reference is probably to adult and juvenile locusts, so translations such as “locusts and grasshoppers\", “large and small locusts” and “adult locusts and their children” are common.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 78:46</span>: In Hebrew this verse again contains both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>chasil</em>, and the reference is again probably to adult and juvenile locusts. The following can therefore serve as a model:","He gave their [newly sprouting] fields to the grasshoppers [young locusts/small locusts]","And their [mature] crops to the locusts [adult locusts/large locusts].","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 105:34</span>: This verse contains both <em>’arbeh</em> and <em>yeleq</em> with similar meaning to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 78:46</span>:","He spoke, and locusts came,","young locusts/grasshoppers beyond number.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 33:4</span>: In this verse the two words for locust are <em>chasil</em> and <em>gev</em>, and the reference, as above, seems to be to juvenile and adult locusts:","Their belongings are plundered as if they were being stripped by grasshoppers [young locusts],","And people swarm over their goods like (adult) locusts.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 1:4; Joel 2:25</span>: In each of these verses there are no less than four different words for locust: <em>gazam</em>, <em>’arbeh</em>, <em>yeleq</em>, and <em>chasil</em>. Most commentators accept that this refers to locusts in four different stages of development. These would presumably be the swarming adult locust, the resident adult locust, the wingless hopper, and the crawling nymph. However, as can be seen above, although <em>yeleq</em> and <em>chasil</em> are both used for juvenile locusts, it is impossible to say which refers to the nymph and which to the hopper.","The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> rendering “what one swarm of locusts left, the next swarm devoured” conveys the general idea, but is technically inaccurate in that not all the Hebrew words necessarily refer to swarming locusts. A more precise translation would be:","What the swarming locusts left, the resident locusts ate;","What the resident locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate;","And what the young hopping locusts left, the young crawling locusts ate.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 3:15; Nah 3:16; Nah 3:17</span>: In the Hebrew poetry of this passage three words for locust are used in parallelisms: <em>’arbeh, yeleq</em> and <em>gov</em>. Regardless of the precise meaning of the words for the different types of officials, it is clear that the three words for locust are synonymous. They are a metaphor for a) large numbers, b) destructiveness, and c) transients (temporary visitors). In many languages there will not be more than one word for locust, if that. Therefore, to avoid the excessive repetition of the one word, slightly different phrases can be used. In the following model translation, there has been an attempt to reflect the structure of the poem, while using different phrases for the three words for locust:","15Even there the fire will eat you,","and the sword will cut you down.","It will eat you as grasshoppers eat a plant.","Multiply","like the grasshopper!","Multiply","like the locust!","16You increased the number of your traders [troops],","until there are more than the stars in the sky.","The locust raids then flies away.","17Your officers [princes] are like grasshoppers,","your diplomats like a swarm of locusts","gathering on stone walls","on a cold day.","The sun comes out,","and they fly away.","Where have they all gone?","No one knows.","There is general consensus that <em>gazam</em> refers to the adult locust, and <em>yeleq</em> and <em>chasil</em> to juvenile forms.

They then wedge the prey under a log or between rocks or reeds and tear large pieces from the carcass by seizing the flesh in their teeth and twisting themselves over and over until the flesh comes loose. They then swallow the meat without chewing it.

Ideophones are especially common in African languages, where their use and definition vary greatly.","<strong>idiom</strong> is a combination of terms whose meanings cannot be understood by adding up the meanings of the parts. “To hang one’s head,” “to have a green thumb,” and “behind the eightball” are American English idioms. Idioms almost always lose their meaning or convey a wrong meaning when translated literally from one language to another.","<strong>literal</strong> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a <strong>figurative</strong> meaning.","<strong>manuscripts</strong> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.","<strong>Masoretic text</strong> is the form of the text of the Hebrew Old Testament established by Hebrew scholars around the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.","<strong>metaphor</strong> is likening one object, event, or state to another by speaking of it as if it were the other; for example, “flowers dancing in the breeze” compares the movement of flowers with dancing. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See <strong>simile</strong>.","<strong>Midrash</strong> refers to the early Jewish interpretations of biblical texts.","<strong>migration (migrate)</strong> refers to the instinctive behavior of some birds and animals that move periodically from one geographical region to another. Migration is usually motivated by the search for food or better climatic conditions.","<strong>modifier</strong> is a grammatical term referring to a word or a phrase that is used to modify or affect the meaning of another part of the sentence, such as an adjective modifying a noun or an adverb modifying a verb.","<strong>onomatopoeic</strong> refers to the use or invention of words that imitate the sounds of what they refer to; for example, “swishing,” “bang!” or “bubble.\"","<strong>order</strong> is the usual major subdivision of a <strong>class</strong> or subclass in the classification of organisms.

In view of the Jewish ancestry and training of the writers of the New Testament, it is not surprising that many Semitic idioms and thought patterns (called Semitisms or Hebraisms) appear in the Greek writings of the New Testament.","<strong>Septuagint</strong> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LXX</abbr>.","<strong>simile</strong> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object by comparing it to another, using “like,” “as,” or some other word to mark or signal the comparison; for example, “She runs like a deer” and “He is as straight as an arrow.” Similes are less subtle than <strong>metaphors</strong> in that metaphors do not mark the comparison with words such as “like” or “as.” See <strong>metaphor</strong>.","<strong>species</strong> is the major subdivision of a <strong>genus</strong> or subgenus, and is regarded as the basic category of biological classification. A species is composed of related individuals that resemble one another, and are able to breed among themselves, but are not able to breed with members of another species.

That duality finds its way into every verse of every chapter of the Bible. The historicity of the text pulls the translator toward formal (word-for-word, sentence-for-sentence) translation. The literary, rhetorical nature of the text pulls the translator toward literary, rhetorical, and poetic equivalence, that is, toward making the same emotive impact on the reader that the original did. That usually requires considerable restructuring and transformation. There is no “happy medium,” only various unhappy ones, or rather, unhappy readers on one side or the other!","Words for trees and plants in the Bible do not escape this dilemma. The first question that a translator must ask is this: Is the immediate context of this word primarily RHETORICAL or primarily NON-RHETORICAL. We say “primarily” here because some texts are difficult to categorize. We say “non-rhetorical” to avoid the word “historical” that carries with it problems of determining what “history” is in the context of ancient texts.","One element of a translator’s task is dealing with technical terms, and particularly whether they should be translated in a way that makes the item familiar to the reader (“domestication”), or leaves the item a bit strange (“foreignization”). A typical example is in measurements. A Bible translator who converts Jewish “cubits” to feet and inches (or to metric units) “domesticates” the text by using measurements that are familiar to the reader, while a translator who leaves “cubits” in the text is (in many cases) “foreignizing” the text. A translator who uses “figi” (from English “fig”) in the text (rather than a local word) is “foreignizing.” The “foreignness” of the whole translation is determined by the accumulation of decisions to domesticate or foreignize measurements, vocabulary, and even grammar, throughout the translation.","The “dynamic/functional equivalence” Bible translation movement in the middle of the twentieth century brought a new thinking, namely, “God speaks your language.” Radical domestication became the norm. But Bible translation theory changes, and right now “foreignization” is not as bad as we used to think. Too much domestication is seen as misleading or even as patronizing, like “baby-talk.” But how much domestication is the right amount? It depends on what the “stakeholders” want. And who are the stakeholders? The publisher, of course, but more important in the long run are the potential readers.","Let us refine the question: How narrow should a translator’s target audience be? Which group of people should be taken as the model for the Bible spellings: rural people with little exposure to other languages? Or cosmopolitan people whose experiences (including radio and television) have been expanded to include a wider range of concepts?","Each magazine or book aims at an audience, who in a sense become the “authority” behind that magazine or book. Bibles are the same. Most European and English Bibles aim at people who are able to handle the “foreignness” of the original Greek and Hebrew technical vocabulary. In this Handbook we try to leave some flexibility in our suggestions for a variety of approaches from foreignizing to domesticating, and for translators in a variety of situations and with a variety of audiences in mind.","To be practical, however, we deliberately attempt to be PRESCRIPTIVE, onerous as that may be to some students of translation. We aim mostly at translators who are doing “dynamic/functional equivalence” translation, with a slant toward taking rhetoric and genre seriously.","Publishers have “style sheets,” recognizing that their set of rules for spelling, format, and style will bring a certain consistency to their many publications, and recognizing also that their set of rules is not universal. Likewise, we promote a consistent approach, and we make no claim that our suggestions for translating Bible terminology are binding on anyone. We can only say that IF a translator follows these suggestions, the result will be within the mainstream of scholarly Bible translation opinion at the beginning of the twenty-first century."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"0.2","book":"flora","title":"References","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"","contentType":"","heading":"","headingHtml":"","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["With each entry appears a list of transliterated Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, or Latin words that represent the plant being discussed.

Botanists distinguish “forest” (dense growth) and “woodland” (less dense growth). Hepper states that Lebanon probably had real forests, whereas the Holy Land would have had “woodland” or “open forest,” except for the dense stands of tamarisk and poplar described in Jeremiah as “the jungle of the Jordan.” Large oak woodland once covered the Sharon Plain, while in the mountains fir, pine, cypress, and Grecian juniper grew plentifully. Other trees and shrubs of the upland woods were the cedar, cypress, fir, ivy, laurel, laurustinus, myrtle, oak, pine, and thyine. Some thrived near streams, namely, the plane, oleander, poplar, elm, and willow.","Trees have engaged in a tug-of-war with various forces throughout the centuries. Natural fires have taken their toll, but the biggest enemy has been human. People have systematically cut down forests for firewood, for timber, and for the production of lime and charcoal, right up to the early twentieth century, when the Turks finished off the oaks by burning them as fuel in their trains and by putting a tax on trees, thereby causing people to cut theirs down to avoid the tax!","The trees have occasionally fought back. In the Sharon Plain, after the original Kermes oaks were cut down during the Arab period (800–1400 A.D.), Tabor oaks replaced them. The remains of a wine press or an oil press now standing in the middle of a forest tell us that now and then Nature wins a battle. But the forests and woodlands are losing the war to cultivation and animal husbandry. Sheep and goats are quite effective in preventing the regeneration of trees. Ever-increasing human populations demand more and more cropland. Chemical fertilizers make it impossible for the long process of regeneration even to begin. It is only thanks to the creation of nature preserves here and there that we know what the forests and woodlands of the Holy Land may have looked like centuries ago.","Occurring almost five times as frequently as <em>ya‘ar</em> (“forest”), the Hebrew word <em>midbar</em> (“wilderness” or “desert”) appears over 270 times in the Old Testament. The majority of these references are found in the Pentateuch, where the saga of the “wilderness experience” of the Israelites unfolds. Subsequent references to <em>midbar</em> often recall the great exodus from Egypt and the wanderings of the descendants of Jacob in Sinai. In those long years they became familiar with many desert species that are now recorded for us in the Bible, species like acacia, broom, boxthorn, date palm, juniper, tamarisk, terebinth, and styrax. They would also have known many others that are not recorded in Scripture. After the conquest of Canaan, the southern part of the country, called <em>Negev</em> (“dry”), became synonymous with “desert.” The Jews who settled there knew its plants and depended on them.","In this chapter we deal with twenty-six trees and shrubs that grew in the uncultivated areas of the Holy Land. The forest, streamside, and desert trees have been mentioned above. We include here two others that were imported from elsewhere, namely ebony from Africa and sandalwood from India.","In at least half of the cases, botanists agree on the identification of the wild trees. The conifers (pine, fir, cypress, cedar) are a particular problem, and debate continues to the present. Following Zohary and others, we propose that the Hebrew word <em>berosh</em> be taken as a generic word covering the Cilician fir, the Grecian juniper, and the cypress. Likewise, there is considerable uncertainty about the streamside trees and about styrax."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"1.1","book":"flora","title":"Acacia","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שִׁטָּה","transliteration":"shittah","references":["Exod 25:5","Exod 25:10","Exod 25:13","Exod 25:23","Exod 25:28","Exod 26:15","Exod 26:26","Exod 26:32","Exod 26:37","Exod 27:1","Exod 27:6","Exod 30:1","Exod 30:5","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:24","Exod 36:20","Exod 36:31","Exod 36:36","Exod 37:1","Exod 37:4","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 37:28","Exod 38:1","Exod 38:6","Deut 10:3","Isa 41:19"],"strongs":["H7848"]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0001_acacia\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0001_acacia.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0001_acacia\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The plural form of <em>shittah</em> (<em>shittim</em>) is used sometimes as a place name (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 25:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 33:49</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 3:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 5:2</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 4:18</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:5</span>), which is evidence of the wide distribution of this tree in Sinai and southern Palestine.

A third variety (<em>Acacia albida</em>) is found in lowland Israel, the Sharon Plain, and lower Galilee. The common acacia was the only tree available to the Israelites for construction of the Tabernacle. Hareuveni discusses the problem of getting enough acacia trees in the wilderness for all the Tabernacle furniture including the 15 meter (50 foot) pole that ran the length of the side wall. He assures us that although most acacias are smaller, there are some that reached 15 meters in height. But would there be a piece straight enough even in a 15 meter acacia to use as a side pole? I doubt it. Then again, they could have joined short pieces to make a long one. Indeed, a collapsable pole would have made transport easier.

Likewise, the German <em>Ginsterstrauch</em> in the German common language version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>) is not well known. Hence, some modern versions use a generic term in 1 Kings, such as “large bush” (Contemporary English Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> ]), “tree” (Good News Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> ], and “bush” (New Century Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> ]). In areas where plants are still known by species names, translators can select a shrub that grows in dry, barren areas (assuming it is big enough to offer shade), or transliterate from the Hebrew (<em>rothem</em>) or a major language (for example, <em>retem</em> in Arabic). Otherwise, they can use “small tree” or “shrub.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 120:4</span> a local kind of wood that produces a very hot fire could be used, since the text is rhetorical, and needs an image of something very hot.","The reference to broom in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 30:4</span> poses major textual and exegetical problems, which explains the variety of renderings in modern Bibles. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> reads “they pick mallow and the leaves of bushes, and to warm themselves the roots of the broom.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and the New International Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) have these poor folk <em>eating</em> the roots of the broom tree. However, reliable sources tell us that the root of the broom tree is poisonous. That is why Moldenke suggested that it must be another plant, namely the parasite Dog’s Club <em>Cynomorium coccineum</em>, which grows up out of the roots of the broom tree. However, there is good evidence that the writer intended to say the roots were “burned” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), not “eaten” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>).

In the few other places where it occurs, it may refer to any one of the three conifers. The logic here is that since cypresses grew in Judea, King Solomon would not need to import them from Lebanon. However, it could also be argued that Lebanon may have produced better specimens than King Solomon could find in Israel and he might have imported some of them. In either case, this does not argue against <em>berosh</em> as a generic term.","Hepper appears to agree with Zohary. Hareuveni identifies <em>berosh</em> as juniper. Thus, if <em>berosh</em> does refer to a single species, current scholarly opinion would support “fir” or “juniper,” but not “cypress” or “pine.” It is quite possible that <em>berosh</em> and its cognates <em>burasu</em> (Akkadian) and <em>brotha</em> (Lebanese Arabic) have been used at different times both as generic terms and as specific terms for one of the conifers.","Regarding the <em>gofer</em> wood that Noah used for his ark (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 6:14</span>), little can be known until actual specimens turn up on Mount Ararat.

The debate hinges on two questions:","1. Is <em>’almug</em> in 1 Kings the same as <em>’algum</em> in 2 Chronicles?","2. Where does the <em>’almug</em> /<em>’algum</em> tree come from?","Note where they are said to come from: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11</span>, <em>’almug</em> from Ophir; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span>, <em>’algum</em> from Lebanon; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span>, <em>’algum</em> from Ophir.","The botanical commentators stand as follows: Zohary, following Tristram, says that the trees are the same, that is, red sandalwood (<em>Pterocarpus santolinus</em>, also called red saunders) from India (via Ophir). Hepper, following Moldenke, Celsius, W. Smith and others, says the trees are different: <em>’almug</em> is the red sandalwood; <em>’algum</em> is the Grecian Juniper <em>Juniperus excelsa</em> of Lebanon.","According to <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FFB</abbr>, the trees are the same, of unknown origin but maybe the red sandalwood, the white sandalwood, or the Phoenician juniper.","The biblical commentators Keil and Delitzsch consider the trees to be the same, namely sandalwood. According to them, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:8</span> the writer mistakenly groups <em>’algum</em> with cedar and cypress as products of Lebanon, whereas <em>’algum</em> should stand separately with “precious stones,” as it does in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span>. Furthermore, G. H. Jones argues it should be <em>’almug</em>, not <em>’algum</em>, on the basis of cognates in Ugaritic (<em>’-l-m-g</em>) and Akkadian (<em>elammakku</em>). Furthermore, a dialect of Sanskrit has the word <em>mocha</em> for the sandalwood tree (see also the appendix below). Adding the Arabic definite article <em>al</em> could explain <em>al-mug</em> (and Arabic typically changes <em>o</em> to <em>u</em> in loan words). Greenfield and Mayrhofer (1967, quoted in Hepper) also hold on philological grounds that <em>’algum</em> and <em>’almug</em> are the same thing; they identify it with a tree from Lebanon which they do not name. Ugaritic records, incidentally, refer to a tree called <em>’-l-m-g</em>.","On a quite different track, Hareuveni (page 99) tries to make a case for translating <em>’almug</em> as “coral,” a mineral product found in the sea, on the ground that <em>’almog</em> is the modern Hebrew word for coral. It makes a good pair with “precious stones.” Hareuveni quotes the Babylonian Talmud, which describes in detail how these “coral trees” are brought up from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.","The translators of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> (following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FFB</abbr>, which follows Koehler and Baumgartner) hold that the phrase “<em>’algum</em> from Lebanon” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> is basic and that it must refer to the Phoenician juniper (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.11.2\">1.11.2 Phoenician juniper (coastal juniper)</a>). Then they harmonize 1 Kings with 2 Chronicles.","Looking at the accounts in 1 Kgs 10 and 2 Chr 9 as stories about Hiram’s contribution to King Solomon, one may observe first of all that the accounts are both awkwardly interrupted by the story of the visit of the queen of Sheba.* They are almost word-for-word parallels except for the <em>’almug</em> /<em>’algum</em> difference. King Hiram brought gold from Ophir, and also, incidentally, <em>’algum</em> /<em>’almug</em> wood and precious stones. 1 Kings refers to <em>’almug</em> three times; the parallel account in 2 Chronicles mentions <em>’algum</em> twice, with the third parallel clearly implied. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that they refer to the same product, and that the variation is caused by the simple inversion of the two Hebrew consonants <em>mem</em> and <em>gimel</em> in one account. Neither account says where the wood came from, but it seems not to be Lebanon. This seems to rule out “juniper” (as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>). And it may not be Ophir. Which of the two readings is earlier? It is generally accepted that the Kings account came first and that the Chronicler used the Deuteronomic Kings account (with <em>’almug</em>) as a reference. Let us assume that <em>’almug</em> is prior.","Note that <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> (8) expresses King Solomon’s desire that King Hiram send him “cedar, cypress and <em>’algum</em>.” There is no exact parallel to this in 1 Kings, but in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:7; 1 Kgs 5:8; 1 Kgs 5:9</span> we have King Hiram’s response to Solomon’s request. He says that he will send Solomon cedar and cypress. There is no reference to any other type of wood. But when we get to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> we find that Hiram sends algum wood and precious stones. We can conclude that <em>’algum</em> was added to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 2:7</span> in order to anticipate the statement in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> (and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11</span>) that Solomon brought <em>’algum</em> wood for use in the Temple. Unfortunately, the way it was added makes it sound as though the precious wood is from Lebanon. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 8:18</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10</span> (interrupted by the queen of Sheba story) clearly separate the gold (from Ophir) from the algum and precious stones (origin unspecified). We conclude that, in adapting the text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 10:11; 1 Kgs 10:12</span>, the scribe preparing <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:10; 2 Chr 9:11</span> inverted the consonants, yielding <em>’algum</em>, and the other reference in 2 Chronicles was adapted to harmonize with the first."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The Red Sandalwood <em>Pterocarpus santolinus</em> is a large tropical tree with hard, reddish wood and yellow flowers.

In some cases it is difficult to know when a particular species was actually domesticated, since the process took place over centuries and much of it happened outside our area of study. Date palms, olives, and figs were probably cultivated quite early, as they could be grown from cuttings.

Humans, with their tools (including fire) and grazing animals, have decimated the forest and other plant life to the point where almost none of it survives except in protected areas. Even the desert has been damaged by the removal of shrubs, leaving the slopes to be eroded down to the bare rock.","On the other hand, the vegetation of the land—both wild and cultivated—has also had a profound effect on the human beings who lived there.

When the conquest finally took place, the newcomers took over a well-developed agriculture that they then developed to a higher level, bringing in plants from Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and other countries.","The effect of agriculture, and particularly of trees, was not just a matter of producing food. The vocabulary of agriculture saturates the language and literature of the Holy Land. Apart from the emotional associations carried by trees such as cedars, oaks, palms, olives and vines, the images of seed, fruit, flower, root, and harvest occur as metaphors over and over in the language of the prophets and in the Wisdom literature, right through to the teachings of Jesus and his followers.","Regarding the translation of names for cultivated trees, our general strategy is that when a tree or shrub is used rhetorically, that is, as a metaphor or simile, then the focus is on the <em>quality</em> of the tree or shrub, not on the botanical details. In that case the translator is urged to find a cultural equivalent carrying that same quality. When the passage is not rhetorical, the translator is compelled by the historicity of the passage to find a botanically related species. When that is not available, it becomes necessary to use a transliteration from a major international language, seek a generic word, or use a descriptive phrase. There is a loss in that, of course.

(There are now some kinds of figs that produce fruit without pollination.) The fruits are about the size of a hen’s egg and can be green, yellow, purple, or brown depending on the type.

It grows along the ground until it finds a tree or other object to climb, using tendrils. It bears bunches of small round fruit that are sweet and juicy. Today farmers grow them commercially throughout the Mediterranean area, in South Africa, in North America, and in many other countries. The first reference to the vine in the Bible (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:20</span>) tells us that Noah planted a vineyard (Hebrew <em>kerem</em>) and that he made an alcoholic drink from the fruit. Farmers since then have improved on the size, color, and quality of the fruit by careful pruning and selection until now there are at least 65 kinds of grapevines. Like many other plants in temperate areas, the vine has leaves that appear in early spring. After the fruit is picked and the weather gets cold, the leaves drop off and the plant is bare until the following spring.","A typical vineyard in Bible times was surrounded by a stone fence. It had a stone tower from which the owner could watch for predators, and a place to squeeze the juice out of the fruits.","References to the vine and its fruits in the Bible are found in descriptions of farms, of sacrifices, and of social interaction."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Special significance:","headingHtml":"Special significance:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0273_grape\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0273_grape.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0273_grape\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The vine is the most frequently cited plant in the Bible, and that alone makes it special. Vines, grapes, raisins, and wine were a major element of Jewish life, so it is not a surprise that the vine and its products are used figuratively probably more than any other Bible plant. After the flood purified the earth at the time of Noah, the vine became the means by which the human race was plunged again into sin (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:20</span>). We know from Jacob’s blessing in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:11; Gen 49:12</span>, from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 16:10</span>, from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 9:13</span>, and from many other passages that the vine was the symbol of blessing, prosperity, and happiness. The fact that there were groups like the Nazirites and Rechabites who abstained from drinking wine simply shows the radical self-denial that these people imposed on themselves (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 6:3; Num 6:4</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 35:2; Jer 35:5; Jer 35:6</span>). A drink offering of wine was an important part of worship (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:40</span>), and the image of contentment was “every man under his vine and under his fig tree” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 4:4</span>). Jotham includes the vine in his well-known Parable of the Trees (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:7</span> ff.). In the New Testament, Jesus rescued a man from humiliation at a wedding party by miraculously providing a fresh supply of wine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 2:1</span> ff.). He compared his teaching to wine. Wine becomes a major symbol in the Christian community when Jesus foreshadows his crucifixion by comparing the wine poured out in the Passover celebration to his blood (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 26:27; Matt 26:28; Matt 26:29</span>). He speaks of the need for Christians to be like the branches of the vine, drawing their nourishment from him, the True Vine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 15:1</span> ff.). Nearly every New Testament writer makes some metaphorical reference to the vine or its products.","The Hebrew word <em>shekar</em> (“strong drink”) probably refers to a alcoholic drink made from grain, honey or dates, but could also have been distilled from wine."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<strong>Vine and vineyard</strong>: There are around 65 kinds of grapevines (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>) found in the Northern Hemisphere. They belong to a larger family of creeping plants called <em>Vitaceae</em>, which has over 800 species throughout the world including many in the tropical and warm climates of the world.","Grapevines have occasionally been grown in West Africa (for example, in The Gambia and in northern Nigeria) but are not well known even where they are grown commercially. Attempts at substituting a local tree name have not been entirely successful because the species chosen is usually not cultivated and/or does not have the same economic or social function that the grape had in Israel.","Thus it is probably best to use a transliteration from a major language. However, in parts of Nigeria and perhaps elsewhere, the word <em>grep</em> refers to “grapefruit” and should be avoided in translation. A transliteration from “vine” or “wine” is preferred, although a translator needs to be careful. The English word “vine” refers to any creeping plant, but it also refers to a particular kind of vine that produces grapes (<em>Vitis vinifera</em>). This can be confusing. Furthermore, translators in English-speaking countries should think carefully about what they are going to do with the word “wine.” In The Gambia, Mandinka translators first used “wayini tree” but later concluded that it may be better to have a word for “vine” that is not necessarily identical with “wine.” <em>Bine</em>, from <em>binekaro</em> (“vinegar”), was considered, as was <em>inabi</em> (“grape”) from Arabic.","Languages that borrow the Arabic word <em>inabi</em> must deal with the fact that this word bears an unfortunate resemblance to <em>annabi</em> (“prophet”) and new readers reading “water of inabi” in a context of prophecy may associate it, for better or worse, with prophets and prophecy. In northern Nigeria church people have gotten used to <em>inabi</em> in the New Testament even though many of them don’t know what it is. Rubassa in Nigeria uses a wild grape-like plant (<em>afwafwa</em>)**, and Igala has used the same species (<em>achiwebetema</em>) for years. Likewise, two translations in Mali and Burkina Faso use their local name for a wild vine (<em>Lannea microcarpa</em>) for the biblical vine. There is a species (<em>Rhoicissus tridentata</em>) in southern and eastern Africa known as “African grape” (locally called “bobbejaantou”). In such cases translators should write a footnote (or glossary item) stating that the grapes of Bible times were larger and sweeter than the local variety, and that they were cultivated extensively as a source for producing beverages. Other possibilities for transliteration are: <em>vinyola</em> /<em>videra</em> (Portuguese), <em>vitis</em> (Latin), and <em>inab</em> (Arabic).","<strong>Fruit of the vine</strong> (Hebrew <em>‘enav</em>; Greek <em>botrus</em>, <em>staphulē</em>): There is some evidence that <em>botrus</em> refers to a bunch of grapes, while <em>staphulē</em> refers to individual grapes. According to Louw and Nida (<em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament based on Semantic Domains</em>), however, both words may refer to individual grapes as well as bunches of grapes. The Hebrew word <em>tirosh</em> is equivalent to the word “vintage” in English, that is, the grape harvest and possibly the first squeezing of the grapes. It is normally used along with the words referring to the olive harvest (<em>yitshar</em>) and grain harvest (<em>dagan</em>).","<strong>Vineyard</strong>: The typical translation solution for translating “vineyard” is to take the word chosen for “vine” and expand to “field/farm of vine trees.”","<strong>Beverages made from vine fruit</strong>: Grape juice contains yeast organisms that make it ferment naturally, converting natural sugar into alcohol or vinegar within a day or two, depending on the weather (Hepper, page 101). In normal wine preparation, the juice (called “must”) is allowed to ferment for six weeks, after which the clear liquid is poured out into another container leaving behind the sediment (the “lees”; see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11</span>) consisting of seeds, twigs, and skins. Once it is in sealed containers for storage it is called <em>yayin</em> in Hebrew. Translators from churches that require abstinence from alcohol are tempted to avoid or downplay the fact that <em>yayin</em> refers to an alcoholic drink. This is difficult to defend since the Jews had no refrigeration to keep <em>yayin</em> cool enough to prevent fermentation.","The Hebrew word <em>tirosh</em>, sometimes translated “new wine,” is problematical. There is no phrase “new wine” in the Hebrew Old Testament or the Septuagint translation of it. The Septuagint usually translated <em>tirosh</em> simply as wine (<em>oinos</em> in Greek). In the New Testament Jesus creates the phrase “new wine” for his parable of the wineskins, linking it with new wineskins (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 9:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 2:22</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 5:37; Luke 5:38</span>); it seems to be a made-up phrase there, not a technical expression. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 6:3; Num 6:4</span> the Nazirites were prohibited from drinking wine, strong drink, and vinegar, or even eating grapes or grapeskins, but <em>tirosh</em> is not mentioned there, suggesting that it may have even been an abstract term like the English word “vintage,” which refers to the grape harvest. The word <em>tirosh</em> is usually used with the Hebrew words for unprocessed grain (<em>dagan</em>) and olive oil (<em>yitshar</em>), in contexts that refer to the produce of the land. What <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> calls “new wine” in these passages is better rendered “vintage” in English. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 24:7</span> <em>tirosh</em> seems to refer to the grapevines themselves (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:15</span> it refers to grapes. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:24</span> it seems to refer to freshly squeezed grape juice. It occurs only twice with the Hebrew verb for “drink” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 62:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 6:15</span>), but in both those passages it can be taken as metonymic, not literal.","Some have tried to argue that <em>tirosh</em> was unfermented grape juice, which may be true in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:24</span>, but that is rather beside the point since it does not refer to a beverage in most cases. Even if <em>tirosh</em> is assumed to include the juice in its first stages on the first day after squeezing, it would have been mildly alcoholic since it has a kind of yeast in it and the Jews had no means of refrigeration. A case in point is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 4:11</span>, which says “<em>Yayin</em> and <em>tirosh</em> take away understanding.” Why? Surely because they contain alcohol! Another example is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:13</span>, where the grapevine in the Parable of the Trees says, “Shall I give up my <em>tirosh</em> that cheers gods and men?” I take <em>tirosh</em> here as a metonym for the final product. But if it is literal, why would it cheer anyone, if not because of its alcoholic content?","Sometimes translators, even if they concede the above, prefer to use a literal expression like “wayin” precisely because it is not well known, and thus hides the problem. This is not very satisfactory. They need to know that there are possibilities for translating these words contextually. For example, in passages where <em>tirosh</em> refers to a product of the land along with grain and oil, a phrase like “the juice of vayin fruit” is an acceptable translation of <em>tirosh</em>. In places where the reference is to drunkenness, the local word for alcoholic drink may be appropriate, and in fact, need not cause any offense. The compulsion to be concordant with English “wine” is what causes the problem.","On the other hand there are communities where <em>yayin</em>, <em>tirosh</em>, and the Greek word <em>oinos</em> have been translated using a word for a locally popular alcoholic brew, such as guinea corn (sorghum) beer. This, however, is not technically accurate. Properly speaking, wine is made from fruit, and beer from grain.","There are a few other Hebrew words that may refer to wine (for example <em>chemer</em>, <em>sove’</em>, <em>mezeg</em>; see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"REALIA:9.1\">9.1 Wine</a>) but they may be generic, or abstract, or poetic, or they refer to a drink made from fruit other than the fruit of the vine, such as pomegranates or dates, so we do not consider them here. In a number of places, wine is referred to indirectly. When a drink offering of wine was required, as in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 15:14</span>, the people are told to bring the offering “out of your wine press [<em>yeqev</em> in Hebrew].”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 28:7</span>: <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders the Hebrew word <em>shekar</em> in this verse as “strong drink.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> take it literally here, saying “fermented drink/liquor.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> is similar with “alcoholic drink.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, and others just use “wine.” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> cleverly does both by rendering this verse as “The wine for the proper drink-offering is to be a quarter of a hin to each ram; you are to pour out this strong drink … .”) Some commentators see this as a strange use of <em>shekar</em>, which normally refers to alcoholic drinks made from grain or honey. They think “wine” was intended and that a late editor used <em>shekar</em> possibly under the influence of Akkadians, who always talked about using <em>shikar</em> for any kind of libation. See <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, pages 374–375, for further discussion."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"גֶּפֶן","transliteration":"gefen","references":["Gen 40:9","Gen

Four types are listed in the Bible: bitter herbs, garlic, leeks, and onions. Apart from these, we know from excavations in the Near East and from Greek and Roman literature that other species of leafy vegetables, such as garden peas and fenugreek (literally “Greek hay”), were harvested and eaten for centuries and even millennia before Bible times. They were almost certainly eaten in Bible times, even though we find no reference to them in Scripture.","The Hebrew word <em>‘esev</em>, which occurs thirty-three times in the Old Testament, means “herbs,” usually edible ones (see, for example <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:3</span>). According to Zohary, the Hebrew phrase <em>‘esev hassadeh</em> (“grass/plants of the field”) presumably refers to edible herbs, pot herbs, and other plants that were gathered in the wild (see, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26</span>). However, as domestication was still going on in Bible times, it is sometimes impossible to know whether a food item was cultivated or gathered.","Another generic Hebrew expression for vegetables is <em>’oroth</em> found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 4:39</span>, where a young prophet goes out to gather <em>’oroth</em> in the field. Zohary, noting that the incident took place near Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, suggests that <em>’oroth</em> may well refer to the garden rocket, known in Arabic as <em>jarjir</em>. His case rests on the fact that the Talmud equates <em>’oroth</em> with <em>gargir</em>. However, the context suggests a general word, so “vegetables” or “herbs” is still the best guess here. This is supported by the fact that the word is plural in form, as well as by the Aramaic translation, which uses a word that is unquestionably generic. <em>’Oroth</em> comes from the Hebrew root <em>’arah</em> (meaning “to gather, collect, pluck”), which also supports that it has here the general idea of “things gathered.”","Another generic Hebrew word here is <em>chatsir</em> (occurring twenty-two times), which Zohary says first referred to “leek” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 11:5</span>), but later changed to mean “grazing grass” or “field herbs” (see, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 37:2</span>).","The Hebrew noun <em>deshe’</em> (occurring fourteen times) is a general term for any plant. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> uses this noun and it verbal form, which are rendered “put forth vegetation.”","Another general Hebrew word for vegetables is <em>yaraq</em>, which occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 11:10; 1 Kgs 21:2; Prov 15:17</span>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 21:2</span> King Ahab covets Naboth’s vineyard to use as his <em>gan yaraq</em> (“vegetable garden”). This sort of expression can cause problems for translators because of the taxonomy and availability of generic terms. Many languages will have words for various types of agricultural plots depending on what is cultivated therein. Naboth’s vineyard was right next to the king’s palace, so the word for “vegetable garden” needs to be appropriate to that situation. If no specific word is available, translators may use a phrase such as “place where I can grow vegetables” or “place where I can plant things.”","The Hebrew word <em>zeru‘a</em> /<em>zero‘nim</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 11:37; Isa 61:11; Dan 1:12; Dan 1:16</span>) is a nominal form of the verb “to plant,” and it literally means “thing sown.” Some versions have rendered it “seed,” “plant” or “what is sown,” depending on the context. Several versions use “vegetables” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 1:12; Dan 1:16</span>.","The Greek word <em>lachanon</em> is a generic word for vegetables in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rom 14:2</span>.

Many plants were in fact used for both incense and medicine. Sweet-smelling goods were an important element of Middle Eastern life in Bible times, as is shown by the fact that Ishmaelites in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:25</span> were carrying “gum, balm, and myrrh” down to Egypt, and Jacob sent the same goods with his sons as a gift to Pharaoh (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 43:11</span>). Cassia and calamus are listed as trade goods from Syria in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 27:19</span>, and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 2:11</span> tells us that scholar-kings brought frankincense and myrrh from the East to Jerusalem. Still others are listed in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:13</span>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:23–Exod 30:25</span> God instructs Moses to take the finest spices and make anointing oil to anoint the priests. Incense was integral to worship, both pagan and Jewish. Spices were also used in embalming, as we know from the story of Jesus’ burial.","Spices come from a variety of sources. Some are lumps of hardened sap (gum, resin) from shrubs; others are the dried leaves or flowers of plants; still others are from the wood or roots of trees. We divide the sixteen plants covered here into two groups: 1) incense and perfume, and 2) balm and ointment. A number of items—gall, henbane, poison hemlock, wormwood and mandrake—do not quite fit in. We will deal with those in Chapter 5.","Before considering the various species, let us take a moment to deal with some generic issues, first in English and then in the biblical languages. The English word “spice” refers primarily to substances that give flavor to food such as cinnamon or pepper. However, when we speak of the “spice trade” we usually include all sorts of other substances that may be used for medicine, perfume, and incense as well.","The English word “balm” can refer to “any of various aromatic resinous substances used for healing and soothing” (<em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>). However, it is also used more specifically to refer to medicinal oil that comes from various tropical trees, and especially those of the genus <em>Commiphora</em>. One of these is the Balsam or Opobalsamum <em>Commiphora gileadensis</em>, from which we get the shortened name “balm.”","Related to the above is the fact that in many languages, a tree may have a different name from the substance it produces. For example, “mastic” comes from the lentisk tree and “ladanum” comes from the rock rose. “Stacte” comes from several kinds of trees, and “storax” comes from the Oriental sweetgum. Stacte and storax are often used interchangeably, as are storax and styrax by some writers, although we distinguish the two in this book.","As for generic terms in Hebrew, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:23–Exod 30:25</span> God instructs Moses to take the finest “spices” (<em>bosem</em>) to make anointing oil. Zohary (page 198) describes the Hebrew word <em>bosem</em> as originally the name of a specific shrub (<em>Commiphora gileadensis</em>) but later it referred to all species of the genus <em>Commiphora</em> and their products. Does <em>bosem</em> refer to dry or liquid substances in this passage? Durham favors dry substances on the grounds that the measurement is in weight rather than volume. However, it could also have been a mixture consisting of the dry ingredients pulverized and mixed in with the liquid ones and the oil. Most English versions of this passage translate <em>bosem</em> as a cover term for the four specific substances that follow: <em>mor deror</em> (“liquid myrrh”), <em>qinnemon besem</em> (“sweet-smelling cinnamon”), <em>qeneh bosem</em> (“aromatic cane”), and <em>qiddah</em> (“cassia”). In translating this passage, a general word or phrase such as “sweet-smelling spices” is recommended for <em>bosem</em>. <em>Bosem</em> and its derivatives (<em>basam</em>, <em>besem</em>) occur at least thirty times in the Bible.","A related generic Hebrew word that may cause problems for translators is <em>sam</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:34</span>, where Moses is given the formula for incense. The English versions use various expressions for <em>sam</em> in this verse; for example, “sweet spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>), “fragrant spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “aromatic substances” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “herbs” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>), and “costly spices” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>). This general word for spices introduces the four substances that made up the incense burned in the Tabernacle, namely <em>nataf</em> (“stacte”), <em>shecheleth</em> (“onycha”), <em>chelbenah</em> (“galbanum”), and <em>levonah</em> (“frankincense”), which will be dealt with below. The word <em>sam</em> occurs sixteen times in the Old Testament.","The Hebrew word <em>tsori</em> is translated “balm” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, but Zohary takes it to refer to a specific plant, namely the Storax <em>Liquidambar orientalis</em>, and Moldenke takes it to be the Egyptian balsam (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:4.2.3\">4.2.3 Liquidambar (Oriental sweetgum, storax)</a>).","The Hebrew word <em>bedolach</em> is problematic. It occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 2:12</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 11:7</span>, where <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> transliterate it as “bdellium.” Botanists have generally held that this Hebrew word does not refer to a plant product. However, a surprising number of versions render it “resin” or “perfume” with one qualifying word or another (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). The Septuagint used the Greek word <em>anthrax</em>, which is a red stone (for example, carbuncle). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr> says “pearls.” Perhaps the safest course is to transliterate <em>bedolach</em>, with or without footnoting other possibilities.","Generic Greek words for spices include <em>arōma</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 16:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 23:56</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 19:40</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 24:15</span>) and <em>amōmon</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:13</span>)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":["FLORA:4.2.3"]},{"key":"4.1","book":"flora","title":"Trees and plants yielding incense and perfume","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.1.1","book":"flora","title":"Agarwood (eaglewood, aloeswood, lignaloes)","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲהָלִים","transliteration":"’ahalim","references":["Num 24:6","Prov 7:17"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֲהָלוֹת","transliteration":"’ahaloth","references":["Ps 45:9","Song 4:14"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0016_agarwood\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0016_agarwood.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0016_agarwood\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Zohary confidently identifies the Hebrew word <em>’ahaloth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:9</span> (8) as referring to the Agarwood or Eaglewood <em>Aquillaria agallocha</em>, which is a tree native to northern India. (He also says it is native to East Africa, but this seems to be a mistake). The ancient Greek writer Dioscorides calls the eaglewood <em>agallochon</em>, a wood found in India and Arabia. This view is supported by Anderson and the commentators Snaith and Budd. Hepper, who is generally suspicious of claims about trade with the Far East in this period of history, doubts this identification but goes along with it for lack of an alternative. The chips of the wood are sold in India under the name <em>agar</em> (Hepper, page 140) and burned as incense. Expeditions like those of King Solomon (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 9:26–1 Kgs 9:28</span>) may have brought this precious commodity from India by way of mysterious places like Tema (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 6:19</span>) or Dedan (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 21:13</span>), possibly in the Arabian Peninsula.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 24:6</span> the Hebrew word <em>’ahalim</em> does not refer to the fragrant chips of the agarwood tree, but the actual trees. The last two lines of this verse read “like aloes [<em>’ahalim</em> ] that the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LORD</abbr> has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.” These parallel lines suggest verdant growth. If the agarwood trees actually grew only in the Far East, what would Balaam or the writer of Numbers know about how they looked? Budd and others suggest that in this verse various elements of nature are combined in an exotic vision of luxury and beauty. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr> renders <em>’ahalim</em> as “oaks,” assuming that a Middle Eastern species was intended.

The tree is called <em>jin-koh</em> in Japanese, <em>chen-xiang</em> in Chinese, and <em>gaharu</em> in Indonesian. Elsewhere, translators will need to consider how they deal with the word pair myrrh and agar. If “myrrh” is transliterated, then “agar” could also be transliterated. In Asia the tree takes its name from the product (agar). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:9; Prov 7:17; Song 4:14</span>, it is the name of the substance that would be transliterated (“agar”), not the tree (“agarwood”).

They are probably generic words that have at one time or other, or in one place or another, referred to various kinds of grass.","According to Zohary, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 41:2; Gen 41:18</span> the Hebrew word <em>’achu</em> (“reed grass”) refers not to a kind of grass but to “damp swampy land used for grazing” (page 127; see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> “meadow”). However, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 8:11</span> seems to speak specifically of some kind of plant (parallel to papyrus), stating that <em>’achu</em> cannot grow where there is no water.","The Hebrew word <em>chashash</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 5:24</span> is used for dry grass, parallel to stubble, referring to the wicked who will be burned up. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 33:11</span> the futile plans of the wicked are likened to <em>chashash</em>, again parallel to stubble.","The eight occurrences of the Hebrew word <em>yereq</em> (“green”) in the Old Testament refer to vegetation. Most of them occur in a phrase such as <em>yereq ‘esev</em> (rendered “green plant” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:30; Gen 9:3</span>) or <em>yereq deshe’</em> (rendered “tender grass” or “green herb” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26; Ps 37:2; Isa 37:27</span>). However, in three passages <em>yereq</em> stands alone (rendered “grass,” “verdue,” or “green thing” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 10:15; Num 22:4; Isa 15:6</span>).","The Hebrew word <em>deshe’</em> is sometimes translated “grass.” It usually occurs in rhetorical contexts, where it is often parallel to <em>chatsir</em>, <em>yereq</em>, or <em>‘esev</em>.","The Hebrew word <em>‘esev</em> occurs thirty-three times in the Bible and is translated by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> as “plant” in twelve of them, as “grass” in twelve, as “herb” or “herbage” in five, and as “vegetation” in four. Since there may be languages that have no generic word like “plant,” they may be able to use their word for “grass” or “growing things” in many of these passages when it is appropriate.","There are a number of words for “pasture,” the grassy fields in which sheep, goats, and cows like to graze. Hebrew has not less than five words: apart from <em>mir‘eh</em>, listed above, there are also <em>migrash</em> (114 times, mostly in Joshua and 1 Chronicles), <em>dover</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 5:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 2:12</span>), <em>kar</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 37:20</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 65:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:23</span>), and <em>nawah</em> (11 times).","Apart from all of the above, there is also the Hebrew word <em>teven</em>, which is translated “straw”—dried grass used for bricks and as bedding for animals. For example, this word occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:25; Gen 24:32</span>, but translators need to be aware that “straw” for the camels was not for the camels to eat but rather was put on the ground to absorb the urine of the animals.","There are two Hebrew words that are usually translated “fodder” (that is, animal food) or “provender”: <em>belil</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 6:5</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 24:6</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:24</span>) and <em>mispo’</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:25</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:32</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 42:27</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 43:24</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 19:19</span>). These words probably refer to some type of grass.","In the New Testament the Greek word <em>chortos</em> occurs fifteen times and is usually translated by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> as “grass.”","The Greek word <em>lachanon</em> occurs four times in the New Testament. It is a generic term for garden plants that can be translated according to its context. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 13:32; Mark 4:32</span> the mustard seed grows to become bigger than all the <em>lachanon</em> (“shrubs”) of the garden. The Pharisees tithe mint, rue, and every <em>lachanon</em> (“herb”) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:42</span>. The weaker brother of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rom 14:2</span> eats only <em>lachanon</em> (“vegetables”).","The Greek word <em>botanē</em> is another generic term.

It is possible that such a distinction was present in Hebrew as well, but at this point we don’t know about it. Before translating, it will be important to investigate how the local people categorize the plant world. Once the local taxonomy is known, the translators can decide how much or how little of it they want to use, depending on their general principles of accommodation in the translation as a whole.","Where possible, the Hebrew word <em>deshe’</em> should carry the meaning of new growth or fresh sprouts of a plant. Since it usually occurs in rhetorical contexts and is often parallel with other references to grass, the translator needs to think of pairs or triplets of words that refer to grass and grass-like plants.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> a: “Let the earth put forth vegetation [<em>deshe’</em> ].” On the basis of this verse’s parallelism with verse 20, I support the majority view here that there are two categories with a generic introducer (see the <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:5.1\">introductory comments</a> on this section). The translator needs the most general word for plants here to render <em>deshe’</em>.* If there is no generic word available, a phrase such as “things with leaves” or “sprouting things” is appropriate. As a last resort, one could simply omit the generic term and translate the specifics.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> b: “Plants yielding seed.” It is difficult to know if the Hebrew phrase here (<em>‘esev mazri‘a zera‘</em>) is talking about plants whose “fruit” is a seed, like rice, or any kind of plants that have seeds, including tomatoes, peppers, grapes, eggplants, and so forth. The English versions stay ambiguous; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> “those that bear grain,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “grain,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> “some to make grain for seeds,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “seed-bearing plants” (also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>; similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>), and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> “plants that bear seed.” “Grain” (equivalent to “corn” in British English) may be too narrow. In either case, this category is set off against what follows, namely, fruit-bearing plants like apples and mangoes.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> c: “Fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed.” The issue here is whether the Hebrew phrase <em>’asher zar‘o vo</em> (“in which is their seed”) is a redundant expression like “of the air” after birds, or whether the phrase actually adds information. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> take it as redundant (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> “those that bear fruit,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “fruit trees”). Others seem to feel it necessary to retain this phrase (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> “others to make fruits with seeds in them,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> “fruit trees … bearing fruit with their seed inside” [similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> ]).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> d: “Each according to its kind.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr> says “each according to its own type.” There seem to be three interpretations of the Hebrew phrase here in the English versions:","1. Some take it as emphasizing the multiplicity of plant types; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> say “all kinds of plants” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>).","2. Some seem to focus on the categorization of plants; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> says “according to their various kinds,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> has “each corresponding to its own species.”","3. Some focus on the reproductivity of plants; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “Every seed will produce more of its own kind of plant” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> has “The seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” Compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, which reads “each with its own kind of seed.”","A major theme of the writer in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> seems to be the orderliness—the categories and subcategories—of creation. This supports <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>. But the repeated use of “seed” indicates that the writer is also interested in the regularity of genetic laws. Echoing this theme, Deuteronomy includes laws strictly forbidding the mixture of different kinds (“seeds” in some languages!) of plants in farms and fibers in clothes. Christ added his own version to this Hebrew concern when he said, “Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 7:16</span>). Possible models for <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 1:11</span> are:","1. Let the earth be covered with plants. Let there be plants with seeds [or, a local subcategory] and trees with fruit [or, a local subcategory]. Let each one have a different kind of seed.","2. Let different kinds of plants sprout from the ground and cover the whole earth. Let there be grass, shrubs, and trees [or, plants with seeds and trees with fruit; or, grain, vegetables, and fruit trees]. Let each kind produce its own.","Translators, after carefully studying the categorization system of their own language, should consider which of the two basic structures of this verse matches their own best. It is quite possible that the three-way division taken by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> and some commentaries would fit the local system better. If so, there is no harm in following it.","Once translators have investigated their local taxonomy, they must decide whether to use it or to try to express the Hebrew categorization. In the absence of middle level generic terms, translators could say “plants like rice” and “plants like mangos,” though this carries the hazard of implying that the original audience had rice or mangos.","The Hebrew categorization is more typological than strictly logical or scientific, so it leaves us with overlap and ambiguity. Probably the most important thing that the writer intends to show is the orderliness of God’s creation.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 19:26</span>: The last two lines of this verse read “like grass [<em>chatsir</em> ] on the housetops; blighted before it is grown” (also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 37:27</span>; similarly <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 129:6</span>). These lines gives us a picture of a house with a flat roof where dust could settle, forming a fertile but shallow environment for the germination of grass seeds. However, the grass was doomed to wither and die quickly because of the lack of moisture and soil. There is a textual problem with the last line. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr> backs the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr>, which reads “blighted/scorced before it rises” (<em>shedefah lifne qamah</em>). It gives a “C” rating to the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> over against the conjecture, which reads “blighted/scorched before the east wind” (<em>shedefah lifne qadim</em>). The conjection is followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">HOTTP</abbr> concludes that the copyist(s), lacking sufficient knowledge of Hebrew, didn’t understand this line and guessed that it might have meant “scorched by the east wind,” which is also very logical. The consensus appears to follow the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> also follows the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">MT</abbr> by saying “blasted

A document from Gezer (in Israel) from around King Saul’s time (1000 <abbr class=\"bible-version\">B.C.</abbr>) refers to the cultivation of flax and states that flax and wool were the main materials for making cloth. According to <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:6</span>, the Israelite spies were hidden under flax stalks by Rahab. Flax was grown extensively in Egypt and made into cloth and mats.","<em>Pesheth</em> and <em>pishtah</em> are probably the original Hebrew words for flax, if indeed the plant was domesticated in the Holy Land, as Zohary proposes. They may be related to the word <em>pashat</em>, meaning “to strip off” or “to flay,” or to the word <em>pasas</em>, meaning “to disintegrate.” <em>Pesheth</em> and <em>pishtah</em> are used twenty times in the Old Testament, twice referring clearly to the plant itself (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 9:31; Josh 2:6</span>). Other references are to the processed flax (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 15:14; Prov 31:13; Isa 19:9; Hos 2:7; Hos 2:11</span> [5, 9]). A few cases refer to finished products, namely wicks (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3; Isa 43:17</span>), cords (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:3</span>), and items of clothing (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 13:1; Ezek 44:17; Ezek 44:18; Ezek 44:18</span>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0234_flax_flower\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0234_flax_flower.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0234_flax_flower\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>It is likely that the Hebrews acquired the word <em>shesh</em> from the Egyptians during their sojourn in Egypt, since flax was cultivated there also. The Egyptian word for flax was <em>shent</em> (via <em>shen-suten</em>). <em>Shesh</em> is used thirty-eight times in the Old Testament: for the material that Pharaoh put on Joseph, for the Tabernacle curtains and hangings in Exodus, for the ephod, and for the priests’ tunics. The wise woman of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:22</span> wears it. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 16:10; Ezek 16:13; Ezek 16:13</span> it is paired with silk, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 27:7</span> “<em>shesh</em> from Egypt” is spoken of as material for the sails of ships.","Several references to linen use the Hebrew word <em>bad</em>. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 28:42</span> the priests’ underwear are made from <em>bad</em>, and it is used thereafter in Leviticus to describe various items of clothing—coat, breeches, girdle, and turban. It turns up again in Samuel’s and King David’s “ephods” and then again in Ezekiel and Daniel, where we see visions of “a man clothed in <em>bad</em>.”","Linen is referred by the Hebrew word <em>buts</em> in 1–2 Chronicles, Esther, and Ezekiel, where the robes of the Temple choir, kings, and rich men are described. Moldenke holds that this word is Assyrian and refers to linen coming from the East. But it could also be a loanword from Egyptian (compare Egyptian <em>nbos</em> “to clothe”); note also the Hebrew verb <em>bots</em> /<em>bits</em>, meaning “whiten” or “bleach” (<em>Unger’s Bible Dictionary</em>). The Septuagint often uses the Greek word <em>bussos</em> or <em>bussinos</em> in these passages.","The Old Testament has four references to the Hebrew word <em>sadin</em> (“linen garment”): <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 14:12</span> (Samson promises them to his opponents), <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:24</span> (the wise woman makes them), and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:23</span> (the rich women of Jerusalem wear them). The Septuagint uses the Greek word <em>bussos</em> or <em>sindōn</em> in these passages.","The Hebrew word <em>’etun</em> occurs only in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 7:16</span>, where it refers to a linen bedspread from Egypt (compare the Greek word <em>othonion</em> for burial cloths, and the Greek word <em>othonē</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 10:11</span> for the sheet in Peter’s vision). Here the Septuagint uses the Greek word <em>amphitapos</em>, which normally referred to a double-sided rug.","In the New Testament there are three primary Greek words for linen: <em>linon</em> /<em>linous</em>, <em>sindōn</em>, and <em>othonē</em> /<em>othonion</em>. <em>Linon</em> is used to refer to garments of the angels in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 15:6</span> as well as to the “smoldering wick” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 12:20</span> (quoting <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3</span> and using the same Greek word as in the Septuagint of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 42:3</span>). The synoptic Gospel writers refer to the linen cloth that Joseph and Nicodemus used to wrap Jesus’ body as a <em>sindōn</em>. Mark uses the same word to refer to the cloth that was worn by the unidentified young man at the time of Jesus’ arrest (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 14:51; Mark 14:52</span>). John uses a different Greek word for Jesus’ burial cloths: <em>othonion</em>.","The rich man referred to in the Lazarus story (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 16:19</span>) is clothed in “fine linen” (<em>bussos</em>). The Greek word <em>bussos</em> is the root word for <em>bussinos</em>, which refers to tunics, robes and turbans made from linen fabric (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 18:16</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 19:8; Rev 19:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 19:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 151 3:6</span>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0232_flax_cutting\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0232_flax_cutting.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0232_flax_cutting\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>It is often difficult to tell whether the Hebrew and Greek words for linen refer to a material or to an item of clothing such as a shirt, robe, tunic, or coat.

Compounding the confusion, some botanists have called the biblical marjoram “Syrian hyssop.” <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</em> suggests that <em>’ezov</em> may have included various plants. We encourage “marjoram” and hold that the term “Syrian hyssop” is Eurocentric. The words <em>’ezov</em> and <em>hussōpos</em> are cognate. A number of botanists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries looked at the Arabic word for “caper bush” (<em>el asaf</em>, which became <em>lassaf</em>) and speculated that <em>’ezov</em> in the Pentateuch must refer to the caper bush (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:3.5.1\">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</a>), which was plentiful in Egypt and the Arabian Desert. Indeed, a caper bush growing out of a wall in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> (4.33) makes much more sense than a marjoram plant in that environment. <em>’Ezov</em> was required in the Jewish purification ceremonies. Is it possible that as the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, where they found plenty of marjoram, that the ceremony of purification evolved, and that the “legal” definition of <em>’ezov</em> could have generalized to include the marjoram?

If the translator chooses to substitute a local plant typically used for sprinkling, a footnote is in order. If translators are used to transliterating from English, “marjoram” is preferred, not “hyssop.” On the other hand, a translator can transliterate from Latin <em>majorana</em>, Spanish <em>mejorana</em>, or Arabic <em>mardakush</em>. So some of the options for rendering “marjoram” are the following:","1. a generic expression, for example, “leaves”;","2. a transliteration (see above);","3. a substitution, that is, a local plant used for sprinkling (plus footnote).","For translators in West Africa who want to use a plant like marjoram, there are marjoram relatives. One such hairy-leafed plant grows in The Gambia and is used as a mosquito repellent. The Tiv of Nigeria call the same plant <em>huuhuu</em>, and the Etsako of Nigeria refer to it as “mosquito grass.” The leaves have a spicy smell and the plant, being hairy, is good as a kind of brush.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> a (4.33a): “He [Solomon] spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop [<em>’ezov</em> ] that grows out of the wall.” This verse has three puzzles:","1. Marjoram (like the European hyssop) is not a tree. It is a relatively low plant with tiny leaves and white flowers. If the translator has a generic word covering both “trees” and “plants,” that should be used. De Vries holds that the Hebrew word <em>‘ets</em> (“tree”) has wider range of meaning than the English word “tree,” because it includes what we would call vines (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 15:2</span>). Still, stretching the word <em>‘ets</em> to include a plant like marjoram is expecting quite a bit, which is partly why a few scholars are still unconvinced that <em>’ezov</em> is the marjoram plant. Hepper, for example, is inclined to agree with Tristram and Balfour who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that <em>’ezov</em> here refers to the caper bush (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:3.5.1\">3.5.1 Caper (caper bush, caper berry)</a>). Part of their argument rests on cognate evidence: Arabic for the caper bush is <em>lassaf</em> (derived from <em>el asaf</em>), which appears to be cognate with <em>’ezov</em>, but the Arabic word for the marjoram (<em>zaatar</em>) is completely unrelated. Someone could argue that the caper is not a tree either, but, significantly, it does have a woody stem.","2. “<em>’Ezov</em> that grows out of the wall” is odd because, in real life, marjoram does not typically grow in the cracks of walls. It likes rocky soil, but is quite unlikely to find its way to walls. Was King Solomon, the great biologist, wrong on a botanical detail that would have been obvious even to school children?","3. Artistically, in this verse, something that grows out of a crack in a wall would make a more striking contrast to the mighty cedar than marjoram would. The caper bush, mentioned above, is an excellent candidate, because it does indeed grow in the cracks of city walls, apart from being a good contrast with the cedar. However, later botanists have not supported this opinion. Also, wider biblical usage votes against it. In Exodus <em>’ezov</em> is used in bunches to sprinkle blood on doorposts. The marjoram, with its hairy stem, is quite suited for such a use. The caper bush is less so. Is it possible that <em>’ezov</em> refers to two different plants in the different contexts? This would not be unprecedented. Zohary, for example, holds that the Hebrew word <em>berosh</em> refers to “cypress” in some contexts and to “fir” in others (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.6\">1.6 Cypress</a>). The same is true of the Hebrew word <em>suf</em>, which can mean “cattail” or “seaweed” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:5.1.1\">5.1.1 Cattail (reed-mace)</a>).","A final piece of evidence that, unfortunately, does not resolve the issue is that the caper bush is abundant in the desert, whereas marjoram prefers cultivated, moister terrain. There may have been marjoram in Egypt when the Israelites left there, but once in the desert they would not have found it. Were they perhaps forced by necessity to use the caper bush for their sprinkling rituals?","The following is a summary of translation options for <em>’ezov</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 5:13</span> (4.33):","1. transliterate from <em>’ezov</em> (<em>esobu</em>, <em>esofi</em>) or marjoram (<em>marjoramu</em>, <em>macora</em>);","2. substitute a local plant that is capable of growing on a wall.","One possible model for the first half of this verse is “Solomon spoke of all kinds of plants/growing things, even the mighty kedari tree of Lebanon [Mountains], and the [little] majoram/esob/kaper/kafer/asafu that can grow on a city wall.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵזוֹב","transliteration":"’ezov","references":["Exod 12:22","Lev 14:4","Lev 14:6","Lev 14:49","Lev 14:51","Lev 14:52","Num 19:6","Num 19:18","1 Kgs 5:13","Ps 51:9"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ὕσσωπος","transliteration":"hussōpos","references":["John 19:29","Heb 9:19"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 12:22","Lev 14:4","Lev 14:6","Lev 14:49","Lev 14:51","Lev 14:52","Num 19:6","Num 19:18","1 Kgs 5:13","Ps 51:9","John 19:29","Heb 9:19"],"crossRefs":["FLORA:1.6","FLORA:3.5.1","FLORA:5.1.1"]},{"key":"5.2.5","book":"flora","title":"Poison hemlock (black henbane, gall)","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"רֹאשׁ, רוֹשׁ","transliteration":"ro’sh, rosh","references":["Deut 29:17","Deut 32:32","Ps 69:22","Jer 8:14","Jer 9:14","Jer 23:15","Lam 3:5","Lam 3:19","Hos 10:4","Amos 6:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"χολή","transliteration":"cholē","references":["Matt 27:34","Acts 8:23"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"discussion","heading":"Discussion:","headingHtml":"Discussion:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0290_hemlock\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0290_hemlock.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0290_hemlock\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0291_hemlock\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0291_hemlock.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0291_hemlock\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure> Zohary suggests that the Hebrew word <em>ro’sh</em> /<em>rosh</em> probably started out as the name of a specific poisonous plant and then was generalized to cover many kinds of plants producing poison. <em>Ro’sh</em> /<em>rosh</em> is often translated “poison” and could have referred to poison conine, derived from Poison Hemlock <em>Conium maculatum</em>.

Readers are reminded that this book is primarily directed to the needs of translators, so it focuses on the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words, what they meant, and how they can be translated in a way that preserves both accuracy (in prose contexts) and naturalness (in rhetorical contexts).","Our problems with identifying the flowers and thorns of the Bible are abundant and complex. First, there are a number of words that could refer to a single plant, to a whole class of plants, or to both. Secondly, we try to identify the Hebrew words for plants in the Old Testament and the Greek words in the New Testament, but the analytical picture is skewed by the fact that the New Testament writers, who quoted the Old Testament frequently, used the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), not the original Hebrew. Finally, there is a very human problem: many readers of the Bible, like the tourists who visit the Holy Land, want specifics. They want to hear that this is the plant that Isaiah, or Jesus, was talking about when they said “mustard” or “lily” or “hyssop.” And, of course, some authors, like tour guides, cheerfully tell readers and tourists what they want to hear. Freshly back from his pilgrimage, a man said to me once, “Now I know what the burning bush was.” Such certainty may strengthen faith, but it is academically unsound. We therefore issue a warning here to the reader: Beware of anything in this or any other book on Bible botany that makes it sound as though we know anything about Bible plants with certainty! The best we have (and that in only a few cases) is a general consensus of scholars. In one case, that of the famous “rose of Sharon,” most scholars would say that it is probably not a rose at all! And the “lilies of the valley” may not have been lilies.","An important fact to keep in mind is that the meanings of words change over time. The time that a book of the Bible was written will determine the interpretation of the words in it. Since we don’t know the date of writing of many books, this makes it difficult to pinpoint meanings of plant names.","Before we go to the Biblical languages, we must point out a potential stumbling block in English.

The walls and doors of Solomon’s Temple were engraved with designs of “open flowers” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:18; 1 Kgs 6:29; 1 Kgs 6:32; 1 Kgs 6:35</span>). Several writers use <em>tsits</em> to picture the short life of human beings (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 14:2; Ps 103:15; Isa 28:1; Isa 40:6; Isa 40:7; Isa 40:8</span>). The verbal form (<em>tsuts</em>) is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 17:23; Isa 27:6; Ezek 7:10</span>. The Greek equivalent for this Hebrew word is <em>anthos</em>, which is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jas 1:10; Jas 1:11</span> and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Pet 1:24; 1 Pet 1:24</span> (quoting <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:6</span>). Did the writers have particular species in mind with the words <em>tsits</em> and <em>anthos</em>? We don’t know, because there are dozens of kinds of flowers that qualify. Of course, this makes it easier for translators since they free to use what is appropriate in the context, as the translators of the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> also did. This is why we find “rose of Sharon” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> in many versions.","The Hebrew word <em>nets</em> occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 40:10</span>, where the vine in the dream of Pharaoh’s butler puts forth “blossoms.” This word also occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:12</span> which speaks of “flowers” appearing on the earth at the time of singing. An abundance of red flowers appears in the spring in the land of the Bible. Interestingly, the Iraqis have a cognate word for this group of flowers (<em>nissan</em>), which, Zohary suggests, supports the proposal that the Hebrew month of Nissan has to do with the appearance of flowers. A related Hebrew noun <em>nitstah</em> is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 15:33</span>, where it refers to the blossoms of the olive tree, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 18:5</span>, where it refers to the blossoms of the grapevine. A related Hebrew verb <em>natsats</em> (“to blossom”) is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eccl 12:5; Song 6:11; Song 7:13</span>.","Mention should be made also of the Hebrew verb <em>parach</em>, which occurs fourteen times with the sense of “blossom,” and its noun form <em>perach</em>, which occurs fifteen times. One important floral reference that uses <em>perach</em> has to do with the golden lampstand in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:31; Exod 25:31; Exod 25:32; Exod 25:33; Exod 25:34; Exod 25:35; Exod 25:36; Exod 25:37; Exod 25:38; Exod 25:39; Exod 25:40</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:17; Exod 37:18; Exod 37:19; Exod 37:20; Exod 37:21; Exod 37:22; Exod 37:23; Exod 37:24</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 8:4</span>. In those passages the lampstand is compared to a flowering plant with stem and blossoms. The tips of the seven branches are described in Hebrew as <em>perach</em> and in the Septuagint as <em>krinon</em>. This suggests that to the translators of the Septuagint, the Greek word <em>krinon</em> had a general sense of “blossom-shaped object” or “flower.” On the other hand, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:26</span>, where the rim of the Temple’s great bronze water basin is described, the Hebrew text says its brim was like <em>perach shushan</em> (“blossom of <em>shushan</em> ”), and the Septuagint has <em>blastos krinou</em> (“blossom of <em>krinon</em> ”), which might suggest that both <em>shushan</em> and <em>krinon</em> designate a specific type of flower or group of flowers with curved petals (rendered “lily” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>). Further, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> <em>chavatseleth</em> and <em>shushan</em> are used in parallel, suggesting that each is specific. The issue is pertinent to the interpretation of many other verses where it is unclear if a specific flower is intended or flowers in general, for example, the phrase “lilies of the field” in the Gospels (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:28</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 12:27</span>). Matthew and Luke used the Greek word <em>krinon</em>, but it is likely that <em>krinon</em> here is generic, referring to many possible flowers, or some common flower, since there were no true lilies growing “in the fields” at that time. (The white lily grew only in forests.) A few of the species that <em>krinon</em> may have referred to are the crown anemone, scarlet crowfoot, common poppy, crown daisy, and dog chamomile.","The Greek word <em>anthos</em> is found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Wis 2:7</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 24:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 39:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 50:8</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Sir 51:15</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Esd 7:16</span>, where in every case but the first one the meaning is “blossom,” that is, the part of a flowering plant that has petals. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Wis 2:7</span> seems to refer to the entire flowering plant.

However, many botanists now believe that <em>shushan</em> could refer to the White Lily <em>Lilium candidum</em>, at least in several contexts. This lily is also known as the Madonna lily due to its frequent association with the Virgin Mary in medieval art and poetry. Zohary believes that the Hebrew word <em>chavatseleth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:1</span> (“rose” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 35:1</span> (“crocus” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) should also be translated as “lily,” but we have reason to disagree with this.","Some scholars have suggested that the <em>shushan</em> adorning the tops of the Temple pillars in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:19; 1 Kgs 7:22</span> are white lilies, on the basis of images engraved into the capitals of columns elsewhere in the Ancient Near East. If so, then it is likely that the <em>shushan</em> used later in the same chapter (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:26</span>) to describe the downward-curving rim of the great bronze water basin outside the Temple could refer the same plant (also found in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 4:5</span>). In all these cases, any type of lily would have been possible, since they all have distinctive curved petals.","The word <em>shushan</em> also occurs in Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel to refer to Susa, the capital city of Persia. Some scholars have written that this name comes from an abundance of lilies found in the area. Others hold that the name comes from “Inshushinak,” the name of the god of the city. This does not necessarily cancel out lilies as the origin of the name; it is a question of what came first.","The word <em>shushan</em> is also found in several Psalm titles (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 45:1; Ps 60:1; Ps 69:1; Ps 80:1</span>), where lilies are appropriate but not necessary to the thought of the passages.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 14:6</span> (5) envisions a renewed Israel that “shall blossom as the lily.”","We also find <em>shushan</em> mentioned in the Song of Songs, where the context suggests a broader range of flowers. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 2:16; Song 6:3</span> refer to pasturing a flock among the <em>shushan</em> in the field. The botanist Moldenke commends <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr> for using “hyacinths” here, a flower blue in color. But it could as well be the crown anemone, the common poppy, or some other flower that blankets the valleys and pastures in the springtime. The third line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 5:13</span> reads “His lips are <em>shoshanim</em>.” Some suggest that the red color is the ground of comparison here, so Ariel and Chana Bloch translate “his lips [are] red lilies.” However, as Murphy points out, “The use of the flower here may have less to do with the color of the man’s lips than with the delight they provide” (page 166). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 7:3</span> (3) the woman is wearing a string of <em>shushan</em> around her waist. They could have been almost any flower, but presumably would have been an abundant one. So, in practice, if not in theory, we recommend a generic expression such as “beautiful flowers” in these verses.","The Greek word <em>krinon</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:28; Luke 12:27</span> is now thought to refer to the crown anemone, the common poppy, or to a whole class of plants (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:6.1.1\">6.1.1 Anemone (crown anemone)</a>).","<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0592_lily\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0592_lily.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0592_lily\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Latin inherited the word <em>lilium</em> from Greek, and references to it in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">3 Macc 2:19; 3 Macc 5:24</span> are generic.

Hepper suggests that <em>barqan</em> could have referred to branches of the boxthorn. The Hebrew and Greek words discussed below are usually translated “thorn,” “bramble,” or “brier” in English. The words “brier” and “bramble” have technical usages. Bramble technically refers to thorny plants in the rose family (genus <em>Rubus</em>), and it includes blackberries and raspberries, both common as food plants in Europe and North America. Brier can refer to a type of rose with pink flowers, also called the sweetbrier or eglantine, or to a prickly vine in the eastern United States called the bullbrier, greenbrier, and other names.","<em>chedeq</em>","In both references to this Hebrew word there is an association with a fence or hedge (<em>mesukah</em>).

Scholars have speculated for centuries over what species <em>akantha</em> refers to in these verses. Linnaeus was so convinced that it must be the Syrian Christ Thorn <em>Ziziphus spina-christi</em> that he made “Christ-thorn” the species name. Others, particularly Hebrew botanists, argue for the Spiny Burnet <em>Sarcopoterium spinosum</em> on the grounds that the soldiers would have taken the most available thorny plant. It could also have been the <em>Paliurus spina-christi</em>, the Lotus Thorn <em>Ziziphus lotus</em>, or the Boxthorn <em>Lycium shawii</em> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.2\">1.2 Boxthorn</a>). We believe that Matthew and John were not interested in the particular bush that the thorns came from, so they used a general word here.","<em>akanthinos</em>","This Greek word is derived from <em>akantha</em>. It is used of the crown of thorns in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 15:17; John 19:5</span>. It seems to be a generic word, meaning “thorny” or “made of thorns.”","<em>batos</em>","The famous burning bush in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 3:2; Exod 3:3; Exod 3:4</span> (<em>seneh</em> in Hebrew) is rendered by the Greek word <em>batos</em> in the Septuagint, and that word is used in the retelling of the story in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37; Acts 7:30; Acts 7:35</span> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.4\">1.4 Burning bush</a>).

It is possible that they used “thorn bush” for <em>ramnos</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">EpJer 1:70</span> because the Septuagint translators used <em>ramnos</em> to translate the Hebrew word for “bramble” (<em>‘atad</em>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:14; Judg 9:15</span> (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"FLORA:1.2\">1.2 Boxthorn</a>).","<em>tribolos</em>","This Greek word only occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 7:16; Heb 6:8</span>, where it is rendered “thistles.” In both passages it is paired with <em>akantha</em>.","<em>spina</em>","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">3 Macc 16:33; 3 Macc 16:78</span> the Latin word <em>spina</em> is used to refer to thorns growing on the roads of a deserted land.

In many cases doublets are involved (for example, “thorns and thistles,” “thorns and briers”) or synonyms in parallel lines. In many languages there may not be nearly as many words in the semantic domain “thorny plants” to choose from as there are in Hebrew, so translators will have to use their vocabulary more than once, trying to be concordant where possible.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:7; Judg 8:16</span>: Two problems arise in these verses. First, the identity of the plant(s) referred to and second, the meaning of the Hebrew verb rendered “flail” (<em>dush</em>). Gideon promises to punish the people of Succoth by flailing their flesh with “thorns” (<em>qots</em>) and “briers” (<em>barqan</em>). The Hebrew verb <em>dush</em> occurs elsewhere with the meaning “thresh,” “trample,” or “beat.” It is unclear here whether Gideon is simply threatening to beat the people of Succoth with thorny branches, or using a metaphor, saying, in effect, “I’m going to deal with your bodies as a farmer threshes/beats his grain at harvest time, only I will use thorny branches.” It must be remembered that threshing was and is done in many ways—by beating the grain with sticks, by having donkeys and oxen tread on it, or by dragging a sledge over it. In the development of agriculture, we can assume that beating by hand came first, followed by having animals trample the grain, and finally, the invention of the sledge, and that the verb <em>dush</em> started with the sense of “beat” and then took on the more specific meanings as the technology changed. The threshing sledge had protrusions on the underside which crushed the grain and made the outer shell come off (see <abbr class=\"bible-version\">WTH</abbr>, <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"REALIA:1.1.8.2\">1.1.8.2 Threshing board, sledge</a>). So some commentators have suggested that <em>barqan</em> here may actually refer to a sledge. However, the simplest solution is often the best, and Gideon’s threat is probably adequately translated by a verb that means “beat” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>) or “whip” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>), rather than by “trample” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>), “thresh” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>), or “flail” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Translating <em>dush</em> as “tear” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>) seems to be going beyond the normal semantic range of that word. Still, the use of “your flesh/bodies” instead of simply “you” raises the possibility that the writer intends something other than just “beat someone with a tool.” So translations following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr> also have some merit.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 5:5</span>: This verse is about God giving rich people their just reward by letting poor people inherit their wealth. The second line seems to say “they will take [the rich man’s] harvest, even from among thorns [<em>tsinnim</em>, plural of <em>tsen</em> ].” Commentators who take <em>tsinnim</em> as thorns here picture either thorny places on the edge of the field, where seed has fallen (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>; see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 13:7</span>) or perhaps a field surrounded by a thorn hedge, which was very common. In the latter case, the sense is that the poor people will even penetrate a thorny fence to take the rich man’s grain (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>).","Various commentators have considered the above situation strange, and have assumed that a word other than “thorns” was intended by the writer. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> take <em>tsinnim</em> as a plural for <em>tsinna’</em> (“basket/pannier”). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> says “carrying it off in baskets,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> has “stronger men seize it from the panniers.” “Stronger men” here results from taking the Hebrew word <em>’el</em> as “strong man” rather than as the preposition “to.” Others, using different emendations, have translated this line as “and carry away to hiding places” (Dhorme), “he takes it to the famished” (Guillaume), “or God shall take it away by blight” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>, using square brackets), and “God snatches it from their mouths” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>). The Septuagint, perhaps following a different text, has “but they shall not be delivered out of calamities.” A number of commentators take this line as untranslatable and delete it. The Jewish commentator Moshe Eisemann adds this bit of explanation: The poor gleaners in the picture are not in a hurry. They take their time gleaning, even taking the grain from the thorny places or from behind thorn hedges, because they have no fear of being chased away. With this in mind, I recommend staying with “thorns” by following <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> or <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NLT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֵדֶק","transliteration":"chedeq","references":["Prov 15:19","Mic 7:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"נַעֲצוּץ","transliteration":"na‘atsuts","references":["Isa 7:19","Isa 55:13"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סִירָה","transliteration":"sirah","references":["Eccl 7:6","Isa 34:13","Hos 2:8","Nah 1:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סַלּוֹן, סִלּוֹן","transliteration":"sallon/sillon","references":["Ezek 2:6","Ezek 28:24"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"צֵן, צְנִינִים","transliteration":"tsen, tseninim","references":["Num 33:55","Josh 23:13","Job 5:5","Prov 22:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קוֹץ","transliteration":"qots","references":["Gen 3:18","Exod 22:5","Judg 8:7","Judg 8:16","2 Sam 23:6","Ps 118:12","Isa 32:13","Isa 33:12","Jer 4:3","Jer 12:13","Ezek 28:24","Hos 10:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֵׂךְ","transliteration":"sek","references":["Num 33:55"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שַׁיִת","transliteration":"shayith","references":["Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שָׁמִיר","transliteration":"shamir","references":["Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4","Isa 32:13"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἄκανθα","transliteration":"akantha","references":["Matt 7:16","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:22","Matt 27:29","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:18","Luke 6:44","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:14","John 19:2","Heb 6:8","Sir 28:24"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀκάνθινος","transliteration":"akanthinos","references":["Mark 15:17","John 19:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"βάτος","transliteration":"batos","references":["Mark 12:26","Luke 6:44","Luke 20:37","Acts 7:30","Acts 7:35"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ῥάμνος","transliteration":"ramnos","references":["EpJer 1:70"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"τρίβολος","transliteration":"tribolos","references":["Matt 7:16","Heb 6:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"spina","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 16:33","3 Macc 16:78"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Prov 15:19","Mic 7:4","Isa 7:19","Isa 55:13","Eccl 7:6","Isa 34:13","Hos 2:8","Nah 1:10","Ezek 2:6","Ezek 28:24","Num 33:55","Josh 23:13","Job 5:5","Prov 22:5","Gen 3:18","Exod 22:5","Judg 8:7","Judg 8:16","2 Sam 23:6","Ps 118:12","Isa 32:13","Isa 33:12","Jer 4:3","Jer 12:13","Hos 10:8","Isa 5:6","Isa 7:23","Isa 7:24","Isa 7:25","Isa 9:17","Isa 10:17","Isa 27:4","Matt 7:16","Matt 13:7","Matt 13:22","Matt 27:29","Mark 4:7","Mark 4:18","Luke 6:44","Luke 8:7","Luke 8:14","John 19:2","Heb 6:8","Sir 28:24","Mark 15:17","John 19:5","Mark 12:26","Luke 20:37","Acts 7:30","Acts 7:35","EpJer 1:70","3 Macc 16:33","3 Macc 16:78"],"crossRefs":["FLORA:1.2","FLORA:1.4","FLORA:6.2.1","REALIA:1.1.8.2"]},{"key":"6.3","book":"flora","title":"Weeds","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"One plant name in the Bible is mentioned with no connotation of its thorniness.

Other terms not defined here may be found in a Bible dictionary.","<strong>ADVERB</strong> is a word that limits, describes, or qualifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. In English “quickly,” “soon,” “primarily,” and “very” are adverbs.","<strong>AMBIGUITY</strong> refers to words or sentences that have more than one possible meaning in a given context. For example, in the sentence “Mike said that if Joe comes, he will speak to the president,” “he” could refer to Mike or to Joe. Thus this sentence is <strong>AMBIGUOUS</strong>. Often what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since intonation and other features of speech help to make the meaning clear. In written discourse, context also helps to indicate which meaning is intended by the author.","<strong>APHRODISIAC</strong> refers to substances, often plants or parts of plants that are believed to enhance sexual desire.","<strong>APOCALYPTIC</strong> refers to a prophetic revelation concerning the end of the temporal world; for example, the book of Revelation is an apocalyptic writing.","The <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong> is a group of books included in the Greek <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> and the Old Testament of the Latin <strong>VULGATE</strong> but not in the <strong>PROTOCANON</strong> of the Hebrew canon. See also <strong>DEUTEROCANON</strong>.","<strong>ARAMAIC</strong> is a <strong>SEMITIC</strong> language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to <strong>HEBREW</strong> and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.","<strong>ARCHEOLOGY (ARCHAEOLOGICAL</strong>) refers to the study from materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text as well as the people of the days when the text was written.","<strong>AROMATIC</strong> refers to the leaves or resin of certain trees that produces a pleasing smell, such as mint, marjoram, or eucalyptus.","<strong>ARTICLE</strong> is a grammatical class of words, often obligatory, which indicate whether the word to which it is connected is definite or indefinite. In English the <strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE</strong> is “the,” and the indefinite article is “a” or “an.”","<strong>BORROWING</strong> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <strong>BORROWED</strong> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”","<strong>CALYX</strong> is the outside part of a flower, usually green in color, which forms a cup-like structure into which the petals and other parts of the flower fit. In the pomegranate, the petals drop, leaving the calyx as part of the fruit.","<strong>CHIASMUS</strong>, or <strong>CHIASTIC STRUCTURE</strong> is a reversal of words or phrases in the second part of an otherwise parallel construction; for example:","A I","B was shapen","C in iniquity","C' in sin","B' did my mother conceive","A' me.","<strong>CLASSIFIER</strong> is a term used with another term (often a proper noun) to indicate to what category the latter belongs. “Town” may serve as a classifier in the phrase “town of Bethlehem,” and “river” as a classifier in “river Jordan.”","<strong>CLAUSE</strong> is a grammatical construction, normally consisting of a subject and a predicate.","<strong>COMMON LANGUAGE VERSION</strong> uses language that is widely understood and accepted by most speakers. In such a translation, substandard speech, dialect peculiarities, and highly literary or technical terms are avoided.","<strong>CONIFERS</strong> are trees such as pine, fir, cypress, and cedar that produce seeds inside of a hard, cone-shaped structure.","<strong>CONNOTATION</strong> involves the emotional attitude of a speaker (or writer) to an expression he uses, and the emotional response of the hearers (or readers). Connotations may be good or bad, strong or weak, and they are often described in such terms as “colloquial,” “taboo,” “vulgar,” “old-fashioned,” and “intimate.”","<strong>CONSONANTS</strong> are speech sounds that are produced by blocking or restricting the passage of air as it comes from the lungs through the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called consonants; for example, “b,” “d,” “f,” “k,” or “m” in English. Consonants were originally the only spoken sounds written in the Hebrew alphabet. Marks for <strong>VOWELS</strong> were added later above or below the consonants. See also <strong>VOWELS</strong>.","<strong>CONTEXT</strong> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.","<strong>CULTURAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a kind of translation in which certain details from the culture of the source language are changed because they have no meaning or may even carry a wrong meaning for speakers of the receptor language. Cultural equivalent translation should be used only when absolutely necessary for conveying the intended meaning, and it may be important to add an explanatory note. See <strong>CULTURE</strong>.","<strong>CULTURE (CULTURAL)</strong> is the combination of beliefs, values, social institutions, customs, and material objects (such as tools or ornaments) of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.","<strong>DECIDUOUS</strong> refers to trees like oaks that drop their leaves during a cold or dry season of the year and produce a new set in the following year. They stand in contrast to “evergreen” trees, which replace leaves as they die continuously throughout the year.","<strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE</strong>. See <strong>ARTICLE</strong>.","<strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.","<strong>DEUTEROCANON (DEUTEROCANONICAL)</strong> is another term for what is referred to by some as the <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong>. These are writings that are included in the Greek <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> and the Old Testament of the Latin <strong>VULGATE</strong> but not in the <strong>PROTOCANON</strong> of the Hebrew canon.","<strong>DOMESTICATE (DOMESTICATION)</strong>, in translation, means to express a foreign word or concept in a way that makes it more like the receptor culture. For example, using “feet” and “inches” in expressing the measurements of Noah’s ark or Solomon’s Temple, rather than cubits, is “domestication.” See <strong>FOREIGNIZE</strong>.","<strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> refers to a translation that tries to give the intended meaning of the source text in a natural and meaningful way so that it produces a response in today’s reader that is essentially equivalent to that of the original reader. <strong>LITERAL</strong> translations pay more attention to reproducing the forms found in the source text. For example, RSV follows the Hebrew wording of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 104:29</span> and says: “they die and return to their dust.” CEV tries to give a dynamic equivalent translation: “they die and rot.”","<strong>EMENDATION (EMEND)</strong> is a correction of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.","<strong>EMPHASIZE</strong> means to give relative importance to an element in a discourse. Emphasis is conveyed by many different devices, depending on the language; for example, positioning of words, emphatic particles, intensifiers, or ideophones. In “Oh, that you had heeded my commandments!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 48:18</span>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>), the particle “Oh” marks this statement as emphatic.","<strong>EQUIVALENCE (EQUIVALENT)</strong> is a very close similarity in meaning or in form. See <strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> and <strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong>.","<strong>ETYMOLOGY</strong> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.","<strong>EXEGESIS (EXEGETICAL)</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct exegesis is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>EXPLICIT</strong> refers to meaning that is expressed overtly in the words of a discourse. This is in contrast to <strong>IMPLICIT</strong> information.","<strong>FAMILY</strong> in botany is a subdivision of an order in the classification of plants or trees. A family usually consists of several <strong>GENERA</strong>.","<strong>FIGURATIVE</strong> expression involves the use of words in other than their <strong>LITERAL</strong> or ordinary sense, in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by comparison or association. For example, when the psalmist says “my cup overflows,” he is not saying his cup is too full. He is rather using a figure of speech to say that he is as content as someone who has been served a generous portion. <strong>METAPHORS</strong> and <strong>SIMILES</strong> are common figures of speech.","<strong>FOREIGNIZE (FOREIGNIZATION)</strong> refers to a general translation strategy that allows cultural items such as measurements, plants, animals, and technology to remain “foreign” to the reader instead of “domesticating” them by substituting cultural equivalents in the receptor language. When a translator converts “cubits” to “meters,” “wolf” to “hyena,” or “oak” to “iroko,” he or she is “domesticating” the text. Leaving “cubits,” “wolf,” or “oak” in a translation in West Africa is foreignizing the text. See <strong>DOMESTICATE</strong>.","<strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong> is a type of translation in which many features of the source text, especially the form of the discourse, have been literally reproduced in the translation. This approach often results in an unnatural style in the receptor language, or sometimes in the lack of any meaning at all. See <strong>LITERAL</strong>.","<strong>FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE</strong> is a type of translation that attempts to convey the same set of communicative functions as that of the original source text. Some important functions of communication are to convey information, to express or evoke emotions, to promote changes in thinking or behavior, or to maintain good interpersonal relations. See also <strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong>, which has a similar meaning.","<strong>GENERAL</strong> or <strong>GENERIC</strong>, refers to a general class or kind of object. It contrasts with PARTICULAR and SPECIFIC. For example, the word “food” is a generic term, while “fruit” is more specific. However, the word “fruit” is a generic term for the more specific word “orange.”","<strong>GENUS</strong> (plural <strong>GENERA</strong>) is the usual major subdivision of a <strong>FAMILY</strong> or subfamily in the classification of organisms. A genus usually consists of more than one species.","<strong>GLOSSARY</strong> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.","<strong>GRAMMAR</strong> refers to the rules governing the formation and arrangement of elements of meaning, words, and larger constructions in a language. If a sentence is grammatical, it follows the rules of normal speech, and sounds correct to a speaker of that language.","<strong>GREEK</strong> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was spoken in the area that is today called Greece. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the <strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong>.","<strong>HEBREW</strong> is the language in which the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the <strong>SEMITIC</strong> family of languages. By the time of Christ, many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language, but spoke <strong>ARAMAIC</strong> (a language related to Hebrew) or <strong>GREEK</strong>.","<strong>IMPLICIT</strong>, or <strong>IMPLIED</strong>, refers to information that is conveyed by a text, but that is not expressed in words. The speaker assumes that the hearer understands the meaning. Often the meaning is clear from the <strong>CONTEXT</strong>. For example, when Hannah says in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:6</span> “He brings down to Sheol and raises up,” the implied or implicit meaning is “raises up to life.” See <strong>EXPLICIT</strong>.","<strong>INTERPRETATION</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct interpretation is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>LINGUISTIC</strong> refers to language, especially the formal structure of language.","<strong>LITERAL</strong> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a <strong>FIGURATIVE</strong> meaning. A literal translation is one that is very close to the forms and word order of the source language; such a translation is frequently unnatural or awkward in the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong>.","<strong>LOAN WORD</strong> is a foreign word that is used in another language, resulting from the process of <strong>BORROWING</strong>. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been <strong>BORROWED</strong> by English speakers for “bullfighter.”.","<strong>MANUSCRIPTS</strong> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.","<strong>MASORETIC TEXT</strong> is the form of the text of the Hebrew Old Testament established by Hebrew scholars around the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.","<strong>MASTIC</strong> is the gum, resin, or sap that is produced by a tree when the inner bark is cut, particularly the gum from the lentisk or pistachio tree, which when it dries in lumps, it is valuable for incense.","<strong>METAPHOR</strong> is likening one object, event, or state (the “topic”) to another (the “image”) to which it is not directly or closely related in meaning. For example, when a person says “I am a worm,” he is describing his state as being lowly, miserable, or of no value. Biblical metaphors are often difficult to understand because the basis for the comparison is not always stated, as in the line “The LORD is my rock” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:2</span>). At other times either the image or the basis of comparison is unfamiliar or used differently in the receptor language. For example, when the psalmist says “He remembers that we are dust” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 103:14</span>), he is not referring to the dirt or dust on our bodies. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See <strong>SIMILE</strong>.","<strong>METONYM (METONYMIC)</strong> is a figure of speech in which a part of an object is used to indicate the entire object (for example, “one hundred head” means “one hundred cows”), or in which an object stands for another object to which it is related (for example, “the crown” can refer to the king or even the entire royal government).","<strong>MODIFY</strong> is to directly affect the meaning of another part of the sentence, as when an adjective modifies a noun or an adverb modifies a verb.","<strong>NEGEV</strong> refers to the desert area in the southern part of the Holy Land.","<strong>NONFIGURATIVE</strong> involves the use of words in their literal or ordinary sense. See <strong>FIGURATIVE</strong>.","<strong>NOUN</strong> is a word that names a person, place, thing, quality, action or idea.","<strong>OVATE</strong> refers to a leaf in the shape of an egg.","<strong>PARABLE</strong> is a short story designed to illustrate or teach some truth, religious principle, or moral lesson. Jesus often used parables to illustrate truths concerning the kingdom of God (for example, the parable of the mustard seed in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 4:30; Mark 4:31; Mark 4:32</span>).","<strong>PARALLEL (PARALLELISM)</strong> generally refers to some similarity in the content and/or form of two parts of a construction; for example, “Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world.” The structures that correspond to each other in the two statements are said to be parallel. <strong>PARALLEL PASSAGES</strong> are two or more portions of biblical text that resemble each other, often by using a series of words that are identical. For example, the Lord’s Prayer as recorded in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:9; Matt 6:10; Matt 6:11; Matt 6:12; Matt 6:13</span> has as its parallel <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:2; Luke 11:3; Luke 11:4</span>.","<strong>PARTICULAR</strong> is the opposite of <strong>GENERAL</strong>.","<strong>PASSAGE</strong> is the text of Scripture in a specific location. It is usually thought of as comprising more than one verse, but it can be a single verse or part of a verse.","<strong>PENTATEUCH</strong> refers to the first five books of the Bible, sometimes called “the Torah,” “the Law,” or “the Books of Moses.”","<strong>PHRASE</strong> is a dependent grammatical construction of two or more words, but less than a complete clause or a sentence. A phrase is usually given a name according to its main word, such as that of a noun phrase, verb phrase, or prepositional phrase. For example, “a purple coat” is a noun phrase, “behind the house” is a prepositional phrase, and “carried a heavy load” is a verb phrase.","<strong>PINNATE</strong> refers to trees or plants that have leaflets arranged on both sides of a stem, sometimes opposite each other, sometimes alternating. Such leaflets are part of what is called a “compound” leaf such as you will find on a frankincense tree.","<strong>PLURAL</strong> refers to the form of a word that indicates more than one. See <strong>SINGULAR</strong>.","<strong>POETRY (POETIC)</strong> refers to a literary genre that differs from everyday speech and from <strong>PROSE</strong> because of its rhythmic and heightened style. Poets use special language to create a mood or image to be shared with the hearer or reader. Each language has special stylistic devices such as figurative language, word order variation, wordplay, repetition or rhyming that are especially frequent in poetry (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 4:0</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 5:0</span>). The boundary between beautiful, artistic prose and poetry is sometimes difficult to determine, but speakers of a language can usually distinguish poetry from ordinary speech. Poetry is usually written or spoken in measured or balanced lines, while prose is not.","<strong>PREFIX</strong> is a part of a word that cannot stand alone and that is positioned at the beginning of the word to which it belongs; for example, “im-possible” or “re-structure.”","<strong>PROSE</strong> is the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without a special style and structure such as elaborate imagery, meter, and rhythm that are often characteristic of <strong>POETRY</strong>. However, literary prose may share some of the features of poetry, such as figures of speech, wordplay, repetition, or even parallelism.","<strong>PROTOCANON</strong> includes the Hebrew books of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament. These books are commonly accepted as canonical by both Protestants and Roman Catholics.","<strong>QUALIFY</strong> is to limit the meaning of a term by means of another term. For example, in “old man,” the term “old” qualifies the term “man.”","<strong>READ (READING)</strong> refers to the wording of a particular manuscript for a passage. Two manuscripts may have different wordings in the same passage, or two versions may have two different meanings. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 1:24</span> the Hebrew text says “three bulls,” but the Greek and Syriac versions say “a three-year-old bull.” These are different readings. See also <strong>TEXT</strong>.","<strong>RECEPTOR</strong> is the person(s) receiving a message. The <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong> is the language into which a translation is made. For example, in a translation from Hebrew into German, Hebrew is the source language and German is the receptor language.","<strong>REDUNDANT</strong> describes anything that is entirely predictable from the context. For example, in “John, he did it,” the pronoun “he” is redundant. A feature may be redundant and yet may be important to retain in certain languages, perhaps for stylistic or grammatical reasons.","<strong>RENDER</strong> means to translate or express in a language different from the original.","<strong>RENDERING</strong> is the manner in which a specific passage is translated from one language to another.","<strong>RESTRUCTURE</strong> is to rearrange the various components of a sentence or other unit of discourse in the translation process.","<strong>RHETORICAL</strong> refers to forms of speech that are employed to highlight or make more attractive some aspect of a discourse. A <strong>RHETORICAL QUESTION</strong>, for example, is not a request for information but is usually a way of making an emphatic statement.","<strong>ROOT</strong> refers to the smallest element of a word, from which other words may be derived. For example, “friend” is the root of “friendliness.” In Hebrew most roots are made up of three consonants, and many words are formed on the basis of this root. For example, the root b-r-k is the basis for the noun “blessing,” the adjective “blessed,” and the verb “to bless.”","<strong>SEMANTIC</strong> refers to meaning. Semantics is the study of the meaning of language forms. Semantic categories (or classes) group words according to their meaning (objects, events, abstracts, etc.) in contrast to grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, etc.) A <strong>SEMANTIC DOMAIN</strong> is a definable area of experience that is referred to by a set of words whose meanings are in some way related. For example, kinship terms constitute a semantic domain. Similarly, the color terms of a language may be said to form a semantic domain.","<strong>Semitic</strong> refers to a family of languages that includes <strong>Hebrew</strong>, <strong>Aramaic</strong>, and Arabic.","<strong>SENTENCE</strong> is a grammatical construction composed of one or more clauses and capable of standing alone..","<strong>SEPTUAGINT</strong> is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, begun some two hundred years before Christ. It is often abbreviated as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LXX</abbr>.","<strong>SIMILE</strong> (pronounced SIM-i-lee) is a figure of speech that describes one event or object (the “topic”) by comparing it to another event or object (the “image”). Similes always use words of comparison such as “like” or “as.” “Your lips [the topic] are like a scarlet thread [the image]” is a simile from <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 4:3</span>. Similes differ from <strong>METAPHORS</strong> in that metaphors do not mark the image with words that indicate comparison. See <strong>METAPHOR</strong>.","<strong>SINGULAR</strong> refers to the form of a word that indicates one thing or person, in contrast to PLURAL, which indicates more than one.","<strong>SPECIFIC</strong> refers to the opposite of <strong>GENERIC</strong>.","<strong>STAMENS</strong> are long thin parts of the inside of a flower that carry pollen.","<strong>STRUCTURE</strong> is the systematic arrangement of the elements of language, including the ways in which words combine into phrases, phrases into clauses, clauses into sentences, and sentences into larger units of discourse. This process can be compared to constructing a building so structures are often spoken of as constructions. To separate and rearrange the various components of a sentence or some other unit of discourse in the translation process is to <strong>RESTRUCTURE</strong> it.","<strong>SUFFIX</strong> is a letter or one or more syllables added to the end of a word, to modify the meaning in some manner. For example, “-s” suffixed to “tree” changes the word from singular to plural, “trees,” while “-ing” suffixed to “sing” changes the verb to a participle, “singing.”","<strong>SYMBOL (SYMBOLIC)</strong> is a form, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, which is arbitrarily and conventionally associated with a particular meaning. For example, the word “cross” is a linguistic symbol, referring to a particular object. Similarly, within the Christian tradition, the cross as an object is a symbol for the death of Jesus.","<strong>SYNONYMS</strong> are words that are different in form but similar in meaning, such as “boy” and “lad.” Expressions that have essentially the same meaning are said to be <strong>SYNONYMOUS</strong>. However, no two words are completely synonymous.","<strong>SYNTAX</strong> is the selection and arrangement of words in phrases, clauses, and sentences.","<strong>SYRIAC</strong> is the name of a <strong>SEMITIC</strong> language, a part of the <strong>ARAMAIC</strong> family, used in Western Asia, into which the Bible was translated at a very early date (the <strong>Syriac version</strong>).","<strong>TARGUM</strong> is an Aramaic translation or paraphrase of a section of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures.","<strong>TEXT (TEXTUAL)</strong> refers to the various Biblical manuscripts. A textual <strong>READING</strong> is the form in which words occur in a particular manuscript (or group of manuscripts), especially where it differs from others. Textual evidence is any evidence from manuscripts that may support a particular reading. <strong>TEXTUAL PROBLEMS</strong> arise when manuscripts contain different readings. These <strong>TEXTUAL VARIATIONS</strong> are readings of the same passage that differ in one or more details. An <strong>EMENDATION</strong> is a scholar’s reconstruction of what the ancient text may have been, even though no manuscript exists today to support that reconstruction. See also MANUSCRIPTS.","<strong>TRANSLATION</strong> is the transfer of a message in a source language text into another language, the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong>. A good translation aims at giving the closest natural equivalent in the receptor language in terms of meaning (content and function) and, if possible, also form (style and structure).","<strong>TRANSLITERATE (TRANSLITERATION)</strong> is to represent in the <strong>RECEPTOR LANGUAGE</strong> the approximate sounds or letters of words occurring in the source language. Transliterating is different from <strong>TRANSLATING</strong>. For example, “Amen” in Hebrew may be transliterated in one language as “amin,” or it may be translated as “So be it.”","<strong>VERBS</strong> are a grammatical class of words that express existence, action, state, or occurrence, such as “be,” “run,” “become,” or “think.” In some languages ideas expressed by adjectives in English may be better expressed by verbs; for example, “to be hot” or “to be angry.”","<strong>VOWELS</strong> are speech sounds of the vocal cords, produced by unobstructed air passing from the lungs though the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called vowels; for example, “a,” “i,” or “u,” which are the most common vowels found in the world’s languages.

Adam is barely out of the garden of Eden when we read that Jubal was “the ancestor of all musicians who play the harp and the flute,” and that Tubal Cain “made all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 4:21</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 4:22</span>; Good News Translation [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>]).","The Bible mentions at least five hundred distinct objects manufactured by humans, and these can present a special challenge to the translator. While there is much that is common to all human experience, and basic material needs remain fairly constant, a number of factors can make it difficult to find the proper equivalent when translating a word for a particular material object. For example, raw materials vary widely, physical conditions may dictate different solutions to a common problem, and technology can differ greatly from one region to another and from one era to another.","The end result is that one present-day culture may not have a word for an object that was common in the lands of the Bible three thousand years ago, while another culture may have ten words for varieties of the same object. In the first case the translator needs to find a way to help the reader understand the meaning and significance of an unknown object; in the second case he or she will probably have to determine which variation of a known item is intended by the Scriptures.","Modern counterparts of ancient things may have changed so much that to use the modern word is to mislead the reader. It is important not to introduce anachronisms into the translation. For example, when rendering the writing implement “pen,” the translator should not choose a word that in normal speech indicates a ballpoint pen. In cases where no word exists in a language for an equivalent object, there are several options. It may be possible to borrow a word from a regional or trade language. Another alternative is to expand the translation somewhat to describe the object or its function. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Amos 7:7</span> the Hebrew text refers to a man as standing “... beside a wall built with a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand” (so Revised Standard Version [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>]), but the Contemporary English Version (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>) expands this to “... beside a wall and holding a string with a weight tied to the end of it. The string and weight had been used to measure the straightness of the wall.” An option open to Bible editions with annotations is to describe an object and its use in a footnote. Finally, it may be possible to include a glossary at the end of a Bible edition and explain difficult terms there.","In some cases, while a specific physical object is mentioned in the text, it is not essential to the understanding of the text. For example, the Hebrew expression “you will possess his gates” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 24:60</span>) may be difficult in some cultures where walled cities with gates are unknown. However, there will be no loss of meaning if we render the clause as “you will capture his city.” This kind of substitute is frequently possible when objects are used figuratively. The translator must be careful, however, not to eliminate the object too quickly but to check if some meaning or significance would be lost if it is replaced through rewording.","It can come as a surprise to find how often physical objects are used in a figurative or metaphorical sense in the Bible. The Greek word for “yoke,” for example, appears five times in the New Testament, always figuratively. Translators must take care to ensure that a literal rendering of the material object will retain the same figurative sense in the receptor language. Where the figurative meaning would be obscured, it may be better not to mention the physical object and simply render the figurative meaning. For example, the statement of the angel to Mary in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 2:35</span> that “a sword will pierce your soul” (New Jerusalem Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>]) may be impossible in some languages. Since the focus is not on the physical object “sword,” a translator may keep the meaning with “you will experience anguish” or find a similar idiom as the New English Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>) has done: “you ... shall be pierced to the heart.”","This book is not intended to be a lexicon on the material culture of the Bible. For this you may use books like those mentioned in the Bibliography. The focus here is the translation task and we have endeavored to keep the needs of the Bible translator in view. For this reason there will normally not be a discussion of how a particular object came into being or the stages through which it developed before its appearance in Scripture. Similarly, the dimensions of material objects are given only with a degree of precision that can help the translator to choose between different options in his or her own culture."]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"","headingHtml":"<strong>Illustrations</strong>","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Most of the items discussed in this Handbook are accompanied by one or more illustrations. While it is recognized that the details of construction of many of the items changed or evolved over the course of the centuries covered by the Bible, it is not the purpose of this Handbook to document that evolution. Illustrations are included here to aid the translator to find the right word or phrase when translating specific Bible verses. In almost no case will the small changes in construction affect the choice of words to be used in a translation. Only where it is thought that this might be the case are different illustrations given showing those changes. Even in such cases, the differences between, for example, early Old Testament times and New Testament times are usually explained only in the written description of the item. Archaeology is constantly uncovering physical objects that throw new light on the material culture of the ancient world. Some of these discoveries change the accepted wisdom about how objects were constructed and used or when they made their first appearance in history. While the author has attempted to represent the current position among scholars, it is to be expected that some of the information will be outdated even before it is printed. It is hoped that the differences will have little adverse effect on the quality of translations.","Some of the illustrations are photographs of objects uncovered in archaeological excavations.

The implement served as a kind of hoe for loosening the soil or like an adze for shaping wood (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.9.3 Axe, adze&lt;REALIA:1.1.9.3&gt;</a>).","“Sickle” (<em>machareshah</em>): Here again <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has followed the Septuagint in translating “sickle” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.6 Sickle&lt;REALIA:1.1.6&gt;</a>).

The rod in the hand of the shepherd or traveler could serve multiple purposes. Sometimes it simply helped to maintain balance while walking over rough ground. It could also be wielded as an offensive or defensive weapon. On offense, it is probably best rendered “club” (see also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">2.7 Club, war club, mace, shattering weapon&lt;REALIA:2.7&gt;</a>). The Hebrew words are similar in meaning, and in several places they are used in poetic parallelism (<em>mateh</em> and <em>shevet</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 27:32</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:5</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:15</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 10:24</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 28:27</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 30:31; Isa 30:32</span>).","Some cultures will have a special word for a staff carried by a shepherd or someone who herds other animals. In other contexts the best rendering will be something like “walking stick” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 11:21</span>). However, in most passages translators should avoid using a word that gives the impression that the user of the stick was somehow feeble or crippled or injured. Such a staff was carried by men of all ages and states of health.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 27:32</span>: The phrase “every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman’s staff” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is probably an allusion to the way in which animals were selected for the tithe. The animals were counted as they passed single file under the staff of the herdsman. Every tenth animal was marked with a red colored stick to show that it had been chosen for the tithe. If this image can be retained in the receptor-language translation while at the same time clearly conveying the idea of counting, then this will probably be better. But the details of the actual procedure are less important than the fact that one of every ten animals was to be designated as belonging to the LORD. One possible model for the whole verse is “When you count your animals, cattle, sheep or goats, every tenth animal must be marked as belonging to the LORD.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 23:4</span>: The Hebrew words <em>shevet</em> and <em>mish‘eneth</em> are used together in this verse as if they are distinguishable objects. We may quote from <em>A Handbook on Psalms</em>: “The <strong>\\+u rod\\+u*</strong> was a club used to drive away wild animals; the <strong>\\+u staff\\+u*</strong> was a long stick used for support in walking. Kirkpatrick takes the two words to be a poetic description of the shepherd’s crook, using two names for the one instrument. So <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr> ‘your shepherd’s rod, that is what reassures me.’ Most translations, however, have two different words. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> [that is, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>] has used the traditional ‘<strong>rod and staff</strong> ’; but since there will be many readers who will not know what these are, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TEV</abbr> qualifies them with ‘<strong>Your shepherd’s rod and staff</strong> ’ ” (page 234).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Cor 4:21</span>: This is the only place where Paul uses the Greek word <em>rhabdos</em>, and its meaning must be determined from the context. It is very unlikely that Paul thinks of a literal stick with which he is threatening to beat his converts. It is also very unlikely that he thinks of himself as a ruler. His authority is “in Christ” (verses 15, 17), and he describes it as the authority of a father (verse 15) or a teacher. Both fathers and teachers had the acknowledged right to correct their children or pupils, if necessary, by using force. This idea is difficult to convey in the setting of many modern societies. Paul’s language also seems to have irony in it. Translators have found different ways of explaining or bringing out the meaning of the word <em>rhabdos</em>. Some maintain the image of the instrument of punishment (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">DUCL</abbr> “a rod in my hand”; Moffatt [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>] and Barclay [Brc] “rod of discipline”). Others focus on the element of punishment; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> begins the second question of this verse with “Do you want me to be hard on you,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “that I come to you with punishment.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has replaced the rod with a whip by saying “Shall I come to you with a whip.” This has been done presumably because a whip or strap is more familiar in English as an instrument of punishment. Some translators will want to follow this model and substitute an instrument better known in their society.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 11:21</span>: In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 47:31</span> the Hebrew word <em>m-t-h</em> can mean either “staff” or “bed,” depending on what vowels are given to the word (see the discussion at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">5.5 Bed, sleeping mat&lt;REALIA:5.5&gt;</a>). Most translations render it “bed.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> is an exception with “staff,” and it gives “bed” in the margin. The writer of Hebrews has followed the Septuagint, which has “staff.” The translator of Hebrews must not try to harmonize these verses but should translate the Greek of this verse, which can only mean “staff.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 2:27; Rev 12:5; Rev 19:15</span>: The literal phrase “to rule … with a rod of iron” appears in these three verses (compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 2:9</span>). This means to rule completely, ruthlessly, crushing all opposition. The “iron rod” was probably a heavy wooden club capped with iron, not a club made of iron.

When the quarry steps on this network, its weight breaks through, and it falls into the pit and is trapped.","“Trap” (<em>pach</em>): This is a general word for a device used to trap animals or especially birds. Here it is explicitly identified as a trap that catches the bird by its foot (literally “heel”).","“Snare” (<em>tsamim</em>): This word may refer to some kind of woven material or mesh that entangles the feet.","“Rope” (<em>chevel</em>): This most likely refers to a hidden noose that is attached at the other end to a bent bough or small tree that springs upright and tightens the noose around the victim when the trap is sprung.","“Trap” (<em>malkodeth</em>): This is a general word for any kind of trap.","Because of the repetition in these three verses, some translations are considerably condensed. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> reduces the six words for traps to only three different words: “(8) Their feet will be caught in a net when they walk into its web. (9) A trap will catch them by the heel and hold them tight. (10) A trap for them is hidden on the ground, right in their path.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> condenses these verses even further: “(8) Before they know it, (9) they are trapped in a net, (10) hidden along the path.” See also the lengthy discussion on these verses in <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em>, pages 339-340.","For the Hebrew word <em>mazor</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Obad 1:7</span>, see the comments in <em>A Handbook on The Books of Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah</em>, page 15.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rom 11:9</span> the Greek words <em>thēra</em> and <em>skandalon</em> are treated as having literal meanings, whereas the passage as a whole is figurative.

As a result, in a number of languages the three terms are reduced often to two, for example, “snare” and “trap.” If there are three different kinds of traps, then, of course, three terms can be used. In some cases, however, it may be preferable to use words to express the acts of catching and trapping as in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, which has “May they be caught and trapped at

The thread thus spun was wound onto the spindle. After the threads were prepared, it was necessary to interlace them at right angles. The <strong>loom</strong> was a device designed to weave cloth in this manner. In the horizontal loom, a series of threads were wound around a thick wooden beam and then tied to another beam. These threads, called the warp, were slightly separated and kept under tension. From the side of the warp another thread (called the woof or weft) was inserted, over the first warp thread, then under the next, and so on until it was passed through the entire warp. To aid this process, the woof thread was attached to a small flat piece of wood or bone, called the <strong>shuttle</strong>.

time of the Persians, money took the form of unstamped pieces of a precious metal such as silver or gold. Coins were only invented in the eighth century B.C., and they did not come into common use in the land of Israel until near the end of the Old Testament period. Coins were small disks made of various kinds of metal. They were stamped or minted with words, symbols, likenesses of leaders, and so on, as a means of identifying their origin and relative values.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Only in a few later writings of the Old Testament (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 29:7</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezra 2:69</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 5:15</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 7:70; Neh 7:71; Neh 7:72</span>) are actual coins in view. It will be necessary in translation to avoid the anachronism of having coins in the narrative at a time when they still had not been invented. While many translations may be technically correct to say “pieces of money,” avoiding the anachronistic mention of “coins,” this is perhaps not the best solution; the average reader will not understand “pieces of money” as meaning anything other than “coins.” In this case it may be better to stay with the literal expression “pieces of silver.” A translation should never use a word that indicates paper money, which did not exist in biblical times.","Where a generic term is lacking for the means of payment locally in use (such as certain seashells in some cultures), a generic plural of a commonly accepted local coin may be possible.","Part of the Greek text of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Macc 15:6</span> is literally “to make your own coinage” (an activity usually reserved for a sovereign power). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “to mint your own coins” takes advantage of a special word in English for this operation. Not all languages have a word for coining or minting money. It is possible to follow the Greek fairly literally and make good sense in many cases.

In some languages a distinction must be made between these two aspects of such objects, and translators must make certain that the particular expression used in a receptor language will at least include the contents and not refer merely to the materials on which the words were written.","Scrolls varied in length but otherwise there was little difference between the physical construction of a short document and a long one. Thus, for example, the Hebrew word <em>sefer</em> may indicate a longer document (“book”), or it can also designate something shorter, which may best be translated “letter,” “writing,” or even “document”; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders it “papers” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 24:1</span> and “letter” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 5:6</span>.","Exceptionally long books might be written on more than one scroll. The Greek word <em>kefalis</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 10:7</span> refers to one such section or scroll of a book.","The codex, or bound book with individual pages, only came into use in the first century B.C. and in common use only a century or two later. Thus, all references to books in the Old Testament, in the Deuterocanon, and probably in the New Testament are to scrolls. Nevertheless, the closest equivalent in most languages for “scroll” is the term used today for “book,” and this will normally be the proper translation.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 29:11; Isa 29:12</span> the Hebrew verb <em>yada’</em> (“know”) occurs with the word <em>sefer</em> to indicate the ability to read and should be translated “knows how to read” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) or “can read” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 1:4</span> the word <em>sefer</em> may indicate either “literature/writings” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>) or the ability “to read and write” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). In some languages the idea of literature may be unfamiliar, but there will probably be some way of talking about “written things,” and this may be the nearest equivalent available.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Tob 7:14</span>: On the scroll in this passage were written the terms of agreement between a man and a woman entering into marriage.

The “lot” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) was probably a set of stones with special markings on them (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.9 Lots&lt;REALIA:4.9&gt;</a>). The stone chosen would show what God’s will was in that particular case. The “line” is the measuring line used to mark out the family plots. The lots may have been used to show where the measuring line should be placed. Most translators prefer to express the general procedure of parceling out the land and its significance rather than trying to render the specific instruments involved in the procedure; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “And so you will never again own property among the LORD’s people,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “So then, when the time comes for the land to be given back to the LORD’s people, there will be no share for any of you.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 11:1</span>: <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders the Greek phrase of three words near the beginning of this verse as “a measuring rod like a staff.” However, the meaning of the Greek is better expressed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> “a long cane like a measuring rod”; compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “a stick that looked like a measuring-rod,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> “a long cane to use as a measuring rod,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “a reed like a measuring rod,” and the Chewa common language translation, which has “a reed for measuring with that looked like a walking stick.” The first Greek word in this phrase is <em>kalamos</em>.

alt=\"WEB-0963_crown_thorns.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In some passages the crown serves only as a symbol of the office of king or queen. In those cultures where royalty (or the office of the supreme leader) is indicated by another symbol, this may be substituted for “crown.” Thus, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Esth 2:17</span> might read “he gave her the royal seal and made her queen in place of Vashti.” Similarly, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 21:4</span> might read “you seat him on the chief’s stool” or “you make him chief.”","In some passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 19:9; Job 31:36; Prov 12:4; Prov 16:31; Prov 17:6; Lam 5:16</span>) it is unclear from the context if the Hebrew word <em>‘atarah</em> refers to a crown or a wreath (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">6.8 Wreath, crown&lt;REALIA:6.8&gt;</a>).","<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Macc 11:13</span> as “Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.” This literal rendering can create a rather silly picture in the mind of the reader. The crowns, of course, simply represent the authority held by Ptolemy in the two regions mentioned here. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has avoided the image of a king trying to balance two crowns on his head by saying “Ptolemy went to the city of Antioch, where he crowned himself king—both of Syria and of Egypt.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> ’s rendering, however, gives the mis­impression that he became king of Syria and Egypt simultaneously.

Ovens, of course, could be put to many uses. Where a language does not have a variety of words, such as “oven,” “furnace” and “kiln” in English, a single word will normally suffice.

While not ruling out the possibility that the anointing here is for medical purposes, there are certainly other factors involved.

The basic concept, however, remained the same: the sword was a long, heavy knife made of metal, at first of bronze, and later of harder metals like iron. In earlier biblical times the blade tended to be more for cutting; it was curved similar to a sickle (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.6 Sickle&lt;REALIA:1.1.6&gt;</a>), but it was sharpened only on the outside of the curve, unlike the sickle, which was sharpened on the inside of the curve. With this type of sword for cutting, no emphasis was placed on a point for piercing. In the later Old Testament period, swords were made more for piercing. These swords, which were as short as 30-40 centimeters (12-16 inches) at first, had relatively broad, pointed blades that were sharpened on both sides. By the time of the Israelite kings, the blades had become longer and relatively narrower.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0382_curved_sword.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In a number of languages the term for “sword” is simply “large knife,” but in some regions it may be called “machete for killing” or “war knife.”","The Hebrew word <em>cherev</em> is a general term and does not specify whether the sword is long or short. Where a language makes a distinction, it will generally be best to translate it “short sword.” In the New Testament the Greek word <em>machaira</em> refers to a short sword and <em>rhomfaia</em> is a long sword. The phrase “with/by the edge of the sword” (occurring over 30 times with over half of them in Joshua and Judges) usually has in view the older, curved sword, which had only one edge. Normally it will not be necessary to render this expression literally, but it will be sufficient to say something like “with/by the sword.”","In many passages we find the phrase “die by the sword” or “slain by the sword” (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 36:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 5:12</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 21:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 31:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 26:52</span>). This is an idiomatic expression meaning to die a violent death. It normally (but not always; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:33</span>) means to die in war, and translators may often use an expression such as “killed in war” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 16:4</span>) or “die in battle.” In such cases it usually indicates a non-heroic death; where a language has a special word or phrase for “die the death of a warrior,” the translator should not use that expression unless such a death is what is intended by the biblical text. In cases where death in warfare is not the meaning, one may say “die a violent death” or “killed by people.” One should not substitute a modern weapon for “sword”; for example, it would be anachronistic to say “shot to death.”","In some passages the word “sword” simply stands for warfare, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 5:12; Rom 8:35; Rev 6:8</span>. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 24:12</span> says literally “Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, [but] not by your sword or your bow” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>). It may be preferable in some languages to translate the last part of this verse without naming the specific weapons: “Your weapons and strength had nothing to do with it.” It is also possible to translate this with both a positive and negative statement: “I defeated them for you. It was not your own strength and weapons that did it.”","The phrase “men who drew the sword” occurs in a number of passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:10; Judg 8:20</span> [6 times]; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 24:9; 1 Chr 21:5</span>). This is simply an idiomatic expression for “soldiers,” which is the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> rendering in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:10</span>.","The phrase “lift up the sword” occurs in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 2:4</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mic 4:3</span> with the meaning “go into battle” or “go to war.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> gives the correct English equivalent by rendering the second to last line in each of these verses as “Nations will never again go to war.” In some languages a literal rendering of the idiom “to lift up the sword” will have quite a different meaning, such as “to surrender” or “to be victorious.” This is not the meaning of the text and should be avoided.","The Hebrew phrase <em>cherev pifiyoth</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 149:6</span>) or <em>cherev piyoth</em> (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 5:4</span>) refers to a sword sharpened on both edges of the blade, that is, a “two-edged sword” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 4:12; Rev 1:16; Rev 2:12; Sir 21:3</span>). This is the straight sword of later Old Testament times and onward.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:5</span> the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>mkerah</em> is doubtful. Most translators connect Jacob’s words to the events described in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 34:25; Gen 34:26</span> and understand <em>mkerah</em> to be a kind of weapon, probably parallel to the “sword” (<em>cherev</em> in Hebrew) in those verses.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 55:22</span> the Hebrew word <em>pthichoth</em> refers to swords that are “drawn” (literally “open”), that is, ready for use. Thus, for the last line of this verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “and he was ready to attack with a sword.” Others prefer to use a simile; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “but they [his words] cut like sharp swords” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “… cut like knives.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 2:35</span> the word “sword” is used figuratively for pain or anguish. Often translators can use a rather literal rendering. Sometimes it is preferable to shift to a simile; for example, the first half of this verse may be rendered “As for your soul, it will be as if a sword pierced it.” In some cases the equivalent expression does not need a term for “sword,” for example, “and you too shall be pierced to the heart” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr>). It is also pos­sible to use a nonfigurative expression, for example, “you will experience anguish.” There is no implication here of a military death, and the translator should avoid the use of a term that might carry that implication."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֶרֶב","transliteration":"cherev","references":["Gen 3:24","Gen 27:40","Gen 31:26","Gen 34:25","Gen 34:26","Gen

The word <em>‘agaloth</em> is related to the Hebrew word for “round,” and this makes it likely that the smaller, round shield is intended. Ancient shields were most commonly made of wood and leather, and frequently rubbed with olive oil. As a result they would burn easily. Where shields are known only to be made of metal, it may be helpful to include a note explaining how shields can be set on fire.","The Hebrew word <em>shemesh</em>, which normally means “sun,” also carries the meaning of a round shield that formed part of the protection at the top of a city wall (see the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">2.19.3 Firing platform, siege tower&lt;REALIA:2.19.3&gt;</a>). Thus, the phrase “sun and shield” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 84:10</span> speaks of two types of shield. Most modern translations wrongly retain “sun,” but compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, which has “rampart and shield.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> gives “bulwark” in the margin. “Protector and glorious king” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> keeps the idea of “sun” in “glorious king,” but it reverses the order as it is found in the Hebrew."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָגֵן","transliteration":"magen","references":["Gen 15:1","Deut 33:29","Judg 5:8","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 22:3","2 Sam 22:31","2 Sam 22:36","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 14:26","1 Kgs 14:27","2 Kgs 19:32","1 Chr 5:18","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 12:9","2 Chr 12:10","2 Chr 14:7","2 Chr 17:17","2 Chr 23:9","2 Chr 26:14","2 Chr 32:5","2 Chr 32:27","Neh 4:10","Job 15:26","Job 41:7","Ps 3:4","Ps 7:11","Ps 18:3","Ps 18:31","Ps 18:36","Ps 28:7","Ps 33:20","Ps 35:2","Ps 47:10","Ps 59:12","Ps 76:4","Ps 84:10","Ps 84:12","Ps 89:19","Ps 115:9","Ps 115:10","Ps 115:11","Ps 119:114","Ps 144:2","Prov 2:7","Prov 6:11","Prov 24:34","Prov 30:5","Song 4:4","Isa 21:5","Isa 22:6","Isa 37:33","Jer 46:3","Jer 46:9","Ezek 23:24","Ezek 27:10","Ezek 38:4","Ezek 38:5","Ezek 39:9","Nah 2:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"עֲגָלָה","transliteration":"‘agalah","references":["Ps 46:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֶׁלֶט","transliteration":"shelet","references":["2 Sam 8:7","2 Kgs 11:10","1 Chr 18:7","2 Chr 23:9","Song 4:4","Jer 51:11","Ezek 27:11"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֶׁמֶשׁ","transliteration":"shemesh","references":["Ps 84:12","Isa 54:12"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Gen 15:1","Deut 33:29","Judg 5:8","2 Sam 1:21","2 Sam 22:3","2 Sam 22:31","2 Sam 22:36","1 Kgs 10:17","1 Kgs 14:26","1 Kgs 14:27","2 Kgs 19:32","1 Chr 5:18","2 Chr 9:16","2 Chr 12:9","2 Chr 12:10","2 Chr 14:7","2 Chr 17:17","2 Chr 23:9","2 Chr 26:14","2 Chr 32:5","2 Chr 32:27","Neh 4:10","Job 15:26","Job 41:7","Ps 3:4","Ps 7:11","Ps 18:3","Ps 18:31","Ps 18:36","Ps 28:7","Ps 33:20","Ps 35:2","Ps 47:10","Ps 59:12","Ps 76:4","Ps 84:10","Ps 84:12","Ps 89:19","Ps 115:9","Ps 115:10","Ps 115:11","Ps 119:114","Ps 144:2","Prov 2:7","Prov 6:11","Prov 24:34","Prov 30:5","Song 4:4","Isa 21:5","Isa 22:6","Isa 37:33","Jer 46:3","Jer 46:9","Ezek 23:24","Ezek 27:10","Ezek 38:4","Ezek 38:5","Ezek 39:9","Nah 2:4","Ps 46:10","2 Sam 8:7","2 Kgs 11:10","1 Chr 18:7","Jer 51:11","Ezek 27:11","Isa 54:12"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.11","book":"realia","title":"Leg armor, leg protectors","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"reference","heading":"Reference:","headingHtml":"Reference:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מִצְחָה","transliteration":"mitschah","references":["1 Sam 17:6"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0388_leg_protectors_roman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Leg armor was protective armor for the lower leg.

Composite bows in particular were very stiff and difficult to string. The underlying idea is preparing the bow for combat. Possible renderings for “bend the bow” are “string the bow” and “prepare the bow for use.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:3</span> a <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “Don’t let the Babylonian soldiers prepare their bows to shoot.”","In some passages the word “bow” symbolizes warfare.

In wartime an attacking army had to find a way to get past the wall and into the city. Five methods were available to the attacker to conquer a fortified city, all of which are reflected in the Bible: 1) penetration over the top of the fortifications; 2) penetration through the fortifications; 3) penetration below the fortifications; 4) penetration by ruse or trickery (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 8:0</span>); and 5) siege. Penetration from above was usually done by scaling the walls using ladders (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Joel 2:7; Joel 2:8; Joel 2:9</span>). Going through the wall could be done by chopping it with hammers, axes, and other tools, by breaking it down using a catapult, or by breaking or burning the gates (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 51:58</span>). Frequently, however, this was accomplished with a battering ram (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 21:22</span>). The attack on the wall was often aided by the building of a siege tower, which put the attackers on a level with the defenders on the wall, making it easier to attack them with arrows and javelins. Penetration from below usually meant the long process of digging a tunnel under the wall. Sometimes, however, it was possible to use an existing tunnel, such as a shaft connecting the city to its water supply (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 5:8</span>).","Defenders of a city were equally ingenious in finding methods to neutralize the efforts of the attacking army. Ladders were pushed over, second walls were built behind the first wall that was about to fall, and large stones or even burning objects could be thrown down on attackers who got close to the wall. In order to protect soldiers working or attacking near the wall, the attacking army would build a large kind of shield that covered the soldiers from above. This device is mentioned by the prophet Nahum: “The attackers rush to the wall and set up the shield for the battering ram” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 2:6</span> b).","When an army did not have the equipment to use one of these methods, or when the terrain was too difficult for an attack, the attacking army could just close off all exits from the city and sit tight. This was called a siege. Its objective was to wait until the people inside the city ran out of food or water and were then ready to surrender (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 25:0</span>)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"2.19.1","book":"realia","title":"Siege wall","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דָּיֵק","transliteration":"dayeq","references":["2 Kgs 25:1","Jer 52:4","Ezek 4:2","Ezek 17:17","Ezek 21:27","Ezek 26:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָצוֹד","transliteration":"matsod","references":["Eccl 9:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מָצוֹר","transliteration":"matsor","references":["Deut 20:20","Ezek 4:2","Mic 4:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"סלל","transliteration":"salal (verb)","references":["Job 19:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"χάραξ","transliteration":"charax","references":["Luke 19:43","PrMan 3:12"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The siege wall was a fence of poles or stakes used to fortify entrenchments.

The collection is also called ‘The Book of Pilgrim Songs.’ The Hebrew word translated <strong>Ascents</strong> comes from the verb ‘to go up,’ but other than this there is no agreement as to what the phrase means. Some take it to indicate the return of the Hebrew exiles from Babylonia; others take it to refer to a stylistic feature found in some of the psalms, in which the order of the statement progresses in a step-like fashion from one verse to the other; others take it to refer to the steps in the Temple precincts which led from one court to the other; the majority take it to refer to the ascent up the mountain on which the Temple was built (Mount Moriah, known as Mount Zion).

Where a language distinguishes between the two, the context should be checked carefully.

It has also been suggested that, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 18:3</span> Paul, Aquila and Priscilla made tents for military use, although the Greek word traditionally translated “tentmaker” more properly means “leather worker.”","It should be kept in mind that in Israel’s earlier history, many people lived in tents. The phrase “went to his tent” or “fled to their tents” often means simply “went home”; for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 14:12</span> is literally “every man fled to his tent,” but, because the context tells us that they lived in houses, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> says “every man fled to his home.”","The Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> means “dwelling place” and is used most often for the Tabernacle in the wilderness (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15.2 Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15.2&gt;</a>). In the passages listed above it refers specifically to a tent for people to live in (either as nomads or as soldiers). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 24:5; Isa 54:2</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 30:18</span><em>mishkan</em> appears in poetic parallelism with a word for “tent.” In these places it will be best to use a general word meaning “dwelling place,” “residence.”","The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>qubah</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 25:8</span> is uncertain.

There will normally be no need to express this in translation. This word is used as a metaphor in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:8</span> for God establishing the earth. Several translations choose to replace the “column” or “pillar” metaphor with “foundations” (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:29</span>: It is most likely that the columns which Samson pushed were made of wood, essentially large logs.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:15; 1 Kgs 7:16; 1 Kgs 7:17; 1 Kgs 7:18; 1 Kgs 7:19; 1 Kgs 7:20; 1 Kgs 7:21; 1 Kgs 7:22</span>: Particular difficulties are presented by the description of the two special bronze columns placed by Solomon on either side of the entrance to the Temple. These columns were even given names.","While <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:15</span> describes the two columns, the Hebrew text makes use of a typical figure of speech, ellipsis: when speaking of the <em>first</em> column and its <em>height</em>, it is understood that the same applies to the <em>second</em> column too; when speaking, then, of the <em>second</em> column and its <em>circumference</em>, it is understood again that the same applies to the <em>first</em> column also. A translation should not try to retain this rather confusing device. While it is possible to describe the dimensions of one of the columns and then add that the second column was the same (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), it is better to give a combined description of the two. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> has “He made two bronze pillars, each one twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet around.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> tries to make the picture even clearer by changing the circumference to an easier-to-visualize diameter: “Hiram made two bronze columns twenty-seven feet tall and about six feet across.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> ’s footnote gives the metric equivalents of the height and circumference: about 8.1 meters high and about 5.4 meters around.","There is an unclear text at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:17</span>, which describes the design of the capitals on these columns, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> both indicate the difficulty in a footnote. Nevertheless, the translator must supply a rendering that makes sense. Thus it is inadequate to provide a literal but unintelligible translation like that of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>: “There were nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.” It should be kept in mind that this is a description of a decorative design that somehow incorporated a network (or “mesh/lattice-work”) in which chains could be found. This should be conveyed to the reader in a description that is as simple as possible. Good examples are <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “The caps [capitals] were decorated with seven rows of designs that looked like chains.” The same idea is probably reflected in the parallel text at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 3:16</span>, where the Hebrew word <em>dvir</em> (normally referring to the Holy of Holies) is thought to be a transposition of the Hebrew letters from the word <em>ravid</em>, which means a kind of chain or necklace. For the first half of this verse <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has “He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:19</span> speaks of capitals in the shape of “lilies” (<em>shushan</em> in Hebrew). It is impossible to know what their exact shape was. While the word <em>shushan</em> is usually translated “lily,” it probably served to designate several kinds of flower. So the Jerusalem Bible (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">JB</abbr>) renders it “flower-shaped,” which, however, could be misleading in some contexts. Where lilies are not known, translators should choose a local flower with a head shaped like a cup.","As part of the description of the two bronze columns, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 7:20</span> uses the Hebrew word <em>beten</em>, which literally means “belly.” This is understood by most translations to be a kind of projection protruding all around the top of each column. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> uses the technical architectural term “cushion,” which will be inappropriate for a common-language translation. Other renderings are “bowl-shaped part/section” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>) and “rounded section/tops” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 38:6</span>: The Hebrew word <em>’adanim</em> is used here in a manner similar to the use of <em>matsuq</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:8</span>, discussed above. The writer of Job thought of the earth as a building set on pillars. These pillars in turn rested on bases. The reference is to the “bases” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) or “footings” on which the pillars rest. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> translates the first line of this verse clearly, saying “On what do its supporting pillars rest?” This line may require more information to make it clear, for example, “On what do the bases rest that hold up the pillars of the earth?” or “What is beneath the footings that support the pillars holding up the earth?”","All the New Testament references to “pillar” are figurative. Some translations prefer to express the meaning rather than retain the pillar figure; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gal 2:9</span>, where “pillars” refers to the leaders in the church, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “the backbone of the church,” while <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “the leaders.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דְּבִיר","transliteration":"dvir","references":["2 Chr

In some instances the fence may consist of piled up logs or sticks; in other instances it may be made of packed dirt or of laid-up stone. What is important, however, is not the form of the “fence,” but its function, and therefore translators may often use a descriptive expression, for example, “barrier to surround a field” or “barrier to keep animals out of the field.” Because stone was such a common material in the land of Israel, fences were usually made of loose stones. In many cultures such stone structures are called “walls,” not “fences.”","The Hebrew word <em>gvul</em>, which normally means “boundary” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.7 Boundary marker&lt;REALIA:3.7&gt;</a>), is used in several places in Ezekiel with a somewhat different meaning. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:12</span> it seems to refer to a “low wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “railing” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), or simply “barrier[s]” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 43:13; Ezek 43:17; Ezek 43:20</span> the word describes a kind of “rim” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) around the base and different levels of the altar.","Some languages distinguish between the outer wall of a building and the inner walls that separate rooms. The Hebrew word <em>chomah</em> normally indicates an outer wall, specifically of a city (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.1&gt;</a>). The references listed above are exceptional. The other Hebrew words can be used for both inner and outer walls, and the translator must decide the correct meaning from the context. The Greek word <em>toichos</em> refers to an inner wall. In translation the outer wall of a house may be called “side of a house,” and an inner wall may be referred to as “partition in a house.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 13:10</span>: In this verse the Hebrew word <em>chayits</em> indicates a “divider,” a wall that is temporary and not very substantial. Translations attempt to indicate this by the addition of a modifier, such as “shaky” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), “flimsy” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, Living Bible [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>]), “weak” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>), “unstable” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>), or “of loose stones” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>).","The Hebrew words <em>shur</em> and <em>shurah</em> have been understood in various ways. They literally mean “row.” This could mean a row of stones, so a wall or a fence. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 49:22</span> most translations have “wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>). However, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 24:11</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders <em>shurah</em> as “olive rows.” As pointed out by <em>A Handbook on The Book of Job</em>, this not likely to be the meaning of the text. Olive trees in the Middle East are very often grown on specially prepared terraces. The terraces themselves are supported by retaining walls, which could be the meaning of <em>shurah</em> here. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr> has abandoned the <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> rendering with “terraces” (also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> says “garden,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr> has “walls.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> choose not to translate the word.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eph 2:14</span> the Greek words <em>mesotoichon</em> and <em>fragmos</em> are used figuratively of the Law, which constituted a barrier between Jews and Gentiles, “the wall of separation” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>).

a variety of roads, either shorter ones within a town or village or longer ones between cities and even countries. Most roads were not paved but were simply paths worn by the passage of many feet and vehicles. Some roads between cites (especially in the Roman period) and more streets within cities and towns were paved, usually with stones.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Some languages contain a wide variety of words for roads within settled areas like towns or cities and also between such urban units. Hebrew and Greek are no exception, with at least a dozen such words. While some of the words are general terms, others indicate roads differing in width, length, or purpose. Translators will, of course, want to choose words in their language that take the context into consideration.","Most of the roads mentioned in the Bible would have been local ways that were little more than wide walking paths. These were usually unpaved, followed the topography, and for the most part would not have been used by vehicles. Some of the roads mentioned in the New Testament were Roman roads and were specially prepared and paved with stone. This kind of road is mentioned, for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 10:46</span>. Strictly speaking, the roads within towns were not “man-made” in the sense that they were not specially constructed according to some plan. They were simply the product of the space between buildings.","Some languages make a distinction between a road inside a town or city and one that passes through the countryside. Where the context is not clear and the language does not have a generic word for “road,” it will usually be best to select a word for a road that connects towns.","As with many languages, words for thoroughfares in Hebrew and Greek often serve figuratively to indicate the “way” a person lives or does something; for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:1</span> praises the person who does not “follow the example of sinners” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). The Hebrew text says literally “does not stand in the way of sinners.” Here a literal translation into English is a mistranslation, because the English idiom “to stand in someone’s way” means to prevent them from acting. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> renders this verse literally by saying “Blessed is the man who does not … stand in the way of sinners … ,” which praises the person who allows sinners to do wrong. This, of course, is not the message of the text.","It is not clear just what Solomon built with algum wood in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 9:11</span>. The hilly topography of Jerusalem and the fact that Solomon used wood indicate that he could have made a kind of path “paved” with wood or even a kind of “boardwalk.” For the Hebrew word <em>msilah</em><abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> has “ramps,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr> says “walkways.” Many translations say “steps” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NASB</abbr>) here but inconsistently translate this word everywhere else as “highway,” “road,” or “path.”","The Hebrew words <em>ma’gal</em> and <em>ma’galah</em> are related to the word for “wagon” or “ox-cart” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">8.2 Cart, wagon&lt;REALIA:8.2&gt;</a>) and indicate the track in which the wheels of a wagon would go.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:2</span>: The word “streets” in this verse follows the Greek text and is the rendering of most translations (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>); Anchor Bible has “market places.” In some languages it may sound odd to have the people standing out in the middle of busy streets praying; any place where large crowds of people normally gather for daily activities, such as “marketplaces” or “street corners” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), would seem a more satisfactory rendering. So instead of “in the streets,” translators may say “out in the middle of towns” or “in the busy parts of towns.” Also in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jdt 1:14</span> the rendering “marketplaces” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) is better than “streets.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹרַח","transliteration":"’orach","references":["Gen 49:17","Judg 5:6","Job 8:13","Job 13:27","Job 16:22","Job 19:8","Job 22:15","Job

In this place, town administration meetings (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 21:19</span>), legal transactions (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:11</span>), and markets (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 7:1</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 7:18</span>) were held (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5 City gate&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5&gt;</a>). It will sometimes be possible in translation to indicate the place by the activity that is taking place there rather than by a word that corresponds to “square.” A good example of this is the way <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:7</span>. The Hebrew reads literally “When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>); <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “Whenever the city elders met and I took my place among them.” Compare also <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 7:12</span>: “or stood waiting at a corner, sometimes in the streets, sometimes in the marketplace.”","While most translations and commentaries understand the Hebrew word <em>rchov</em> to mean “city square,” some understand it in the more general sense of “street” in some passages (and this indeed has become its only meaning in modern Hebrew); for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr> renders it “street[s]” in all but three instances, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, while usually rendering <em>rchov</em> as “square[s],” has “streets” in about one-third of its appearances. By way of example, most translations render <em>rchovoth</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Dan 9:25</span> as “streets”; some common-language translations (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">ITCL</abbr>) avoid a direct translation of <em>rchovoth</em> by speaking of “Jerusalem” being reconstructed."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"רְחֹב","transliteration":"rchov","references":["Gen 19:2","Deut 13:17","Judg 19:15","Judg 19:17","Judg 19:20","2 Sam 21:12","2 Chr 29:4","2 Chr 32:6","Ezra 10:9","Neh 8:1","Neh 8:3","Neh 8:16","Neh 8:16","Esth 4:6","Esth 6:9","Esth 6:11","Job 29:7","Ps 55:12","Ps 144:14","Prov 1:20","Prov 5:16","Prov 7:12","Prov 22:13","Prov 26:13","Song 3:2","Isa 15:3","Isa 59:14","Jer 5:1","Jer 9:20","Jer 48:38","Jer 49:26","Jer 50:30","Lam 2:11","Lam 2:12","Lam 4:18","Ezek 16:24","Ezek 16:31","Dan 9:25","Amos 5:16","Nah 2:5","Zech 8:4","Zech 8:5","Zech 8:5"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀγορά","transliteration":"agora","references":["Matt 11:16","Matt 20:3","Matt 23:7","Mark 6:56","Mark 7:4","Mark 12:38","Luke 7:32","Luke 11:43","Luke 20:46","Acts 16:19","Acts 17:17","Tob 2:3","2 Macc 10:2","Ps 151 2:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἀγορανομία","transliteration":"agoranomia","references":["2 Macc 3:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"εὐρύχωρος","transliteration":"euruchōros","references":["Ps 151 5:46","Ps 151 9:6","Ps 151 9:38","Ps 151 9:41"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Gen 19:2","Deut 13:17","Judg 19:15","Judg 19:17","Judg 19:20","2 Sam 21:12","2 Chr 29:4","2 Chr 32:6","Ezra 10:9","Neh 8:1","Neh 8:3","Neh 8:16","Esth 4:6","Esth 6:9","Esth 6:11","Job 29:7","Ps 55:12","Ps 144:14","Prov 1:20","Prov 5:16","Prov 7:12","Prov 22:13","Prov 26:13","Song 3:2","Isa 15:3","Isa 59:14","Jer 5:1","Jer 9:20","Jer 48:38","Jer 49:26","Jer 50:30","Lam 2:11","Lam 2:12","Lam 4:18","Ezek 16:24","Ezek 16:31","Dan 9:25","Amos 5:16","Nah 2:5","Zech 8:4","Zech 8:5","Matt 11:16","Matt 20:3","Matt 23:7","Mark 6:56","Mark 7:4","Mark 12:38","Luke 7:32","Luke 11:43","Luke 20:46","Acts 16:19","Acts 17:17","Tob 2:3","2 Macc 10:2","Ps 151 2:14","2 Macc 3:4","Ps 151 5:46","Ps 151 9:6","Ps 151 9:38","Ps 151 9:41"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.13.3","book":"realia","title":"City fortifications","depth":2,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.1","label":"3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement","text":"3.13.3.1 City wall, rampart, battlement"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.2","label":"3.13.3.2 Fortress, stronghold, castle, citadel, fort","text":"3.13.3.2 Fortress, stronghold, castle, citadel, fort"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.3","label":"3.13.3.3 Watchtower, tower","text":"3.13.3.3 Watchtower, tower"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.4","label":"3.13.3.4 Moat","text":"3.13.3.4 Moat"},{"target":"REALIA:3.13.3.5","label":"3.13.3.5 City gate","text":"3.13.3.5 City gate"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Ancient cities were often built with special fortifications to protect the inhabitants from attacks from the outside.

However, such a fence may not be wide enough for people to walk on. Where the text speaks of people walking or doing other things on the city wall, translators should avoid creating a picture that will look impossible or ridiculous to the readers. In such cases, it may be necessary to expand with something like “thick fence made of stones around a city” or “fortified fence around a city.”","The Hebrew words <em>chel</em> and <em>chomah</em> appear several times parallel to each other. There may be some distinction between them, where <em>chel</em> speaks of extra fortification or strengthening of a <em>chomah</em>. However, where only one term for a city wall exists, it will usually be possible to treat them as one term. Where <em>chel</em> and its related terms stand alone, translators may add a modifier, saying “strong wall” or “fortified wall.”","In a few places (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 25:16; Prov 18:11; Song 8:9; Song 8:10; Isa 26:1; Jer 15:20; Zech 2:9</span>) the word <em>chomah</em> is used figuratively, signifying strength or protection. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 25:16</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has dropped the wall figure and begins simply with “They protected us.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Josh 2:15</span> refers to Rahab’s “house built into the city wall” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). Archaeological excavations reveal that at one time Jericho had two city walls, an inner one and an outer one, separated by a space of about 3.5 to 4.5 meters (11.5-14.5 feet). Houses were built on heavy timbers laid from one wall to the other. The window through which Rahab let the men down looked out from the outer wall. The phrase “a house built into the city wall” could possibly be unclear; it may be more satisfactory to translate “a section of the city wall formed the outside wall of Rahab’s house.” Moreover, it may even be necessary to include a footnote, indicating more precisely the relation between the house and the city wall.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jdt 14:1</span>: Where a technical term for

Large gates could also be found at the entrances to large complexes such as the Temple or the residences of the rich. Gateway construction varied at different periods, having two, four, or six parallel guardrooms on either side of the gateway. At other times gateways were built having one or more ninety degree turns, usually to the left (in order to expose the side of the attacking soldier which was not covered by his shield). The entrance of the gateway was closed by a thick door, normally made of wood. The door was usually made of two parts, each part hanging on hinges from each side of the gateway. These two parts of the gate were pushed together and then secured in place by one or more heavy wooden bars from the inside (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5.1 Gate bar, bolt&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5.1&gt;</a>).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\" alt=\"PTZ-0070_city_gate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>In most of the passages listed above (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 14:13</span>), the reference is to the entranceway and not specifically to the gates as objects. In some passages, however (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:3</span>), it is the doors of the entranceway that are in focus. In many cultures walled towns with gates are unknown, and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 16:3</span> it may be necessary to expand the literal clause “he took hold of the doors of the gate of the city” as follows: “he took hold of the large doors in the wall that surrounded the city.”","In ancient cities, business and discussion were often conducted in the gateway (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 23:10; Gen 23:18; Ruth 4:1; Ruth 4:11</span>; see also <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.2 Square, marketplace&lt;REALIA:3.13.2&gt;</a>). It was the place where the elders or important men of the city gathered (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:7</span>). The city gate could also serve as a place of judgment (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 21:19; Josh 20:4</span>) or punishment (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 17:5; Deut 22:24</span>). <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 31:21</span> probably refers to the city gate as a place of judgment also. The second line of this verse is literally “because I saw my help in the gate.” This refers to having the support and backing of the other officials in the town. If Job had wanted to mistreat anyone, he could have counted on those men who sat on the town council to defend him. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “knowing I could win in court” means that Job has the support of the local court system (that met at the city gate) to defend his case. We may also render the whole verse as “I have never threatened to harm an orphan, even though I knew the officials would be on my side if I did.” <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 127:5</span> also refers to the city gate as a court. The second half of this verse is literally “He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). The “enemies in the gate” are a man’s adversaries in a legal dispute; the open space near the inner gate of the city was the place where legal disputes were settled. If he had a number of grown sons with him, a man would be more likely to win in a legal dispute with his adversaries. In some languages there is a term for a designated place in the village where village elders meet for hearings. In cases where there is no such customary place, “in the gate” is sometimes rendered “in the place where men meet to decide matters.” Compare also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 22:22; Prov 24:7; Prov 31:23; Isa 29:21; Lam 5:14; Amos 5:10; Amos 5:12; Amos 5:15; Zech 8:16</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 22:17; Gen 24:60</span>: The literal expression “shall possess the gates of their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 22:17</span> is an idiomatic way of saying “will conquer their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) or “will defeat their enemies” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 20:10</span>: Here a Hebrew idiom speaks of people who are “within your gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). This refers to the territory controlled by someone. So <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “in your country,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> uses “in your towns,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “in your cities.” Compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 5:14; Deut 12:12; Deut 12:15; Deut 12:18; Deut 12:18; Deut 12:21; Deut 14:21; Deut 14:27; Deut 14:28; Deut 14:29; Deut 15:7</span>. Generally this idiom may be rendered “in your land,” “in your towns,” or “in your cities.” The expression should not be misunderstood as referring to people who, by a different metaphor, “sit in the gate,” that is, are members of the local leadership.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 3:11</span>: In the literal expression “the whole gate of my people,” “gate” refers to the city, and “the whole gate” is a reference to the whole city in the sense of “all the people of the city” or “all of the citizens.” It is rare that a translator can use a term for “gate” in reference to a city. <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 4:10</span> speaks literally of Mahlon’s name not being “cut off … from the gate of his place.” Here again “gate” is a metonym for the whole town. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> expresses this positively, saying “his family line will continue … in his hometown.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> is also good: “he will be remembered in this town.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 18:24</span>: The literal phrase “between the two gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) reflects the construction of city gates. The stronger walled cities had an outer and an inner gate, with a covered passage or narrow entrance hall between them. Along the sides of the passage were usually rooms occupied by guards (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.13.3.5.2 Guardroom&lt;REALIA:3.13.3.5.2&gt;</a>). The translator can make the picture reasonably clear with an expanded translation, for example, “between the inner and outer gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) or “between the inner and outer gates of the city” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> is similar to <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> and adds the following note: “The city gate was often like a tower in the city wall, with one gate on the outside of the wall and another gate on the inside of the wall.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 31:31</span>: “and let her works praise her in the gates” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). Here “gates” stands for the place where people gather, a public place. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> says “praise her in public for what she has done” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>), and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “She deserves the respect of everyone.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 16:18</span>: The literal phrase “the gates of Hades” is an idiom for death or the power that death holds over humanity. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> have “the powers of death.” For the last clause of this verse, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> says “death itself will not have any power over it.” There is a parallel expression in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 38:10</span>, where Hezekiah complains that the little time he has to live will be dominated by the fact of his impending death: “I had thought: I must depart in the middle of my days; I have been consigned to the gates of Sheol [meaning ‘world of the dead’] For the rest of my years” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). Compare <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>: “I thought that in the prime of life I was going to the world of the dead, Never to live out my life.” In both passages the translator should not try to retain the reference to gates unless it will be natural in the receptor language; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 38:10</span> in English, Hezekiah might speak of being “at death’s door.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 3:2</span>: There are two opinions concerning the identification of the gate mentioned only in this passage. Some authorities believe it was the Nicanor Gate, made of polished Corinthian bronze, which according to Josephus exceeded all the other gates in value and which gave access from the Women’s Court to the Court of Israel. But from the context, which says that Peter and John were “going in,” it seems more probable the gate here called “Beautiful” was the Golden Gate, also called Shushan. Jewish tradition knows nothing about a gate called the Beautiful Gate. However, translators do not need to concern themselves with the identification of the gate; it is sufficient to say “the Beautiful Gate” or “the gate called Beautiful.” Translators normally capitalize the name of the gate.","About 40 verses make reference to “gatekeeper[s].” A gatekeeper was a man who was responsible to sit by a closed gate and identify those desiring to enter. He would open the gate (of the city, the Temple, a palace, or perhaps to the courtyard of a rich man) only for those who were allowed to enter."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"דֶּלֶת","transliteration":"deleth","references":["Deut 3:5","Josh 6:26","Judg 16:3","1 Sam 21:14","1 Sam 23:7","1 Kgs 16:34","2 Chr 8:5","2 Chr

It is possible, however, to see a parallelism between the first two lines of the verse and the last two lines, where “gate bar” in the first line is parallel to “scepter” (<em>shevet</em> in Hebrew) in the third line. This would mean that the gate bar is a metaphor for the ruler. Of the translations consulted, only <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr> comes close to this approach with “I shall crush the nobles of Damascus ... and the sceptred ruler of Beth-eden.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Nah 3:13</span>: It is not clear whether the bars and gates mentioned here are to be taken literally or figuratively. If they are understood figuratively, then the “bars” probably stand for the fortresses that guarded the mountain passes, which are called “gates” earlier in the verse. If they are understood literally, then the “bars” would be the wooden beams that prevented the gates of Nineveh from being opened. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> follows this interpretation and renders the last half of this verse as “Fire will destroy the bars across your gates.” Probably it is better either to take both the gates and bars as figurative, or both as literal. If translators take both the gates and bars as figurative, a possible translation model is “The borders of your land are wide open to your enemies, and fire will destroy your fortresses.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 3:3; Neh 3:6; Neh 3:13; Neh 3:14; Neh 3:15</span> lists both <em>briach</em> and <em>man‘ul</em> as part of the gate. They were in fact parts of the system for securing the gate from the inside so that it could not be opened. The Hebrew word <em>briach</em> refers to a pole or bar, while the word <em>man‘ul</em> comes from a root meaning “to close.” Most translations render the two objects as “bolts and bars.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “metal bolts and wooden beams as locks” suggests the materials from which these objects were made and the function they served. The exact structure and function of the <em>man‘ul</em> is not clear.

From the time it was first built by Solomon, it was the center of worship for the Jewish people. In Jewish history three temples were constructed, all of them quite different from the others. The first Temple, built by Solomon, was destroyed in 587/586 B.C. A new, more modest Temple was built about seventy years later by Zerubbabel and lasted until almost the time of the New Testament, when it was rebuilt by Herod the Great.

In the New Testament the Greek word <em>naos</em> refers to a single building, while the word <em>hieron</em> points to the entire Temple precinct with its buildings, courts, and storerooms. Even though in a number of contexts it is not necessary to distinguish between <em>hieron</em> and <em>naos</em>, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 21:12</span> (and the parallel passages <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 11:15; Luke 19:45; John 2:14</span>), it is important to indicate this distinction in order not to leave the impression that sacrificial animals were actually being sold inside the central sanctuary.

People could bring their donations (not coins, which were not yet invented) and insert them into the box through the hole. The donations could then be removed by opening or removing the top.","In some passages the Hebrew word <em>’otsar</em> refers to treasure (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 24:13; 2 Chr 12:9</span>), while in other places it indicates the place where treasure was stored, that is, a treasury (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 20:13; 2 Chr 32:27</span>). The first half of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 15:18</span> says literally “And Asa took all the remaining silver and gold in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and [he took] the treasures of the king’s house.” No translation consulted makes the distinction, although some render both words “treasures” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), while others render both words “treasuries” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). In fact, in many of the references under <em>’otsar</em> it is not easy to determine if the meaning is “treasure” or “treasure storehouse.” In only three places is there specific reference in Hebrew to a “treasure house” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Neh 10:39; Dan 1:2; Mal 3:10</span>).","Where a word for “treasury” is not available, it may be rendered with a descriptive phrase, such as “safe place where the king’s [or, Temple’s] valuables were kept/were guarded.” An alternative model for the last half of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 27:6</span> is “It is against our Law to put it with the money that belongs to the Temple since it is blood money.”","In the New Testament the Greek word <em>gazofulakion</em> also refers to a box in which donations were collected. According to Jewish tradition, there were thirteen such offering boxes in the Temple, and the receptacles that channeled the money down to the boxes were in the form of trumpets or rams’ horns. As a result, the sound of coins falling into the boxes was rather conspicuous. In some cultures such a collection box may be unknown, or at best people know the container that is passed around to collect money in church. If possible, the translation should indicate that the offering box was in a fixed place and not something passed around.

Even a corresponding word for “curtain” could be misleading since it might suggest something that covers a window. Frequently it is necessary to use some kind of descriptive equivalent, for example, “large piece of cloth hanging down from the ceiling” or “large piece of cloth covering the entrance.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:31</span> provides a description of this object. The “veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; Hebrew <em>paroketh</em>) was a “curtain” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), of course, but it is good to distinguish this from the “screen” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; Hebrew <em>masak</em>) at the entrance to the Tabernacle, which was also a curtain (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:36</span> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15.2.3.8 Screen, entrance curtain&lt;REALIA:3.15.2.3.8&gt;</a>). The word <em>masak</em> has the primary meaning of covering something, or even hiding something, while <em>paroketh</em> primarily means making a division and setting something apart. Some translations make no distinction between the two words (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>), but others have “curtain/screen” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “veil/curtain” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “Veil/Screen” (Durham), “screen/covering” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOT</abbr>), and even “curtain/veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). The <em>paroketh</em>, however, was there to separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:33</span>).

From the description of Solomon’s Temple in H01100600600058 we learn that many things were made of wood and then overlaid with gold. Since it was difficult to overlay stone with gold, it was sometimes the practice to cover the stone first with a thin layer of wood paneling or veneer and then overlay the wood with gold. Even though there is no mention of gold overlay in Ezekiel’s description of the future Temple, it has been suggested that such a wood veneer covered the inner stone walls and was itself overlaid with gold. A translator should not, of course, introduce gold where none is mentioned. The phrase <em>schif</em><em>‘ets</em> has been rendered “paneled with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “trimmed in wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>), “covered with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>), “framed with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), and “overlaid with wood” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>).","The Hebrew word <em>migra‘ah</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 6:6</span> describes a structural device in Solomon’s Temple.

Rather than make a hole right through the Temple wall, they made a recess or niche (or narrow ledge) in which the end of the beam sat. This supporting feature is called a <em>migra‘ah</em>.

The most important of these ziggurats are the ones of Ur and of Babylon, dating respectively from the end of the third and the beginning of the second millennium B.C. The ziggurat in Ur is square, measuring 43.3 meters (142 feet) wide by about 62.5 meters (205 feet) long.

As in the case of the ziggurat in Ur, the one in Babylon had three flights of steps—two lateral ones 30.5 meters (100 feet) high and a central one 40 meters (132 feet) high. According to a tablet found in the ruins of the nearby sanctuary of Esagil, it must have had a height of about 91.5 meters (300 feet). The Greek historian Herodotus (<em>Histories</em>, Book I, 181 [185]) describes this ziggurat as being square and having eight levels or “towers” one on top of the other. Like the ziggurat in Ur, it had a shrine near its middle, to which there was access partly by a flight of steps and partly by a ramp.","In most translations it will be sufficient to translate the Hebrew word <em>migdal</em> as “tower” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 11:4; Gen 11:5</span>.

Translating Two Traditions.” The following is extracted from Osborn’s conclusions:","It is fairly clear that there are two different traditions in the book of Exodus concerning the way in which the people of Israel were equipped to move on from their encounter with Yahweh at Mount Sinai. Both traditions describe a portable shrine that would have been necessary for the years of wilderness wandering that lay ahead. Both provide a means for ensuring the presence of Yahweh and the continuing covenant relationship as they begin their journey into the future. But the differences between these traditions may still be recognized in the text as we have it—significant “voices” that need to be heard if we are to understand and appreciate how Yahweh actually did work with these people through succeeding generations.","So I feel that the translator must be sensitive to the voices which can be heard through the text. In the case of the terminology of these traditions, therefore, I would propose the following guidelines:","1) Since both traditions refer to a portable shrine, the terms selected in translation should themselves suggest the idea of a tent or a portable dwelling. It may be possible in many languages to speak of a “tent of meeting” and a “tent of dwelling.” In most contexts, then, the use of the single word “tent” should be adequate, without unnecessary confusion to the reader.","2) In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 33:7; Exod 33:8; Exod 33:9; Exod 33:10; Exod 33:11</span>, it should be clear in the terms used that the tent outside the camp where Moses met with Yahweh from time to time is not the same tent that was constructed with all its parts and equipment in the following chapters.","3) In most cases, where the wider context clearly suggests the elaborate tabernacle, and the immediate context does not include conflicting characteristics of the simple tent of meeting, I see no problem in using a single term referring to the tabernacle. But where there are traces of those earlier voices in the text, there should be a way to preserve them in translation. A last resort would be a footnote giving a literal translation of the Hebrew.","4) In the four cases [<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:7</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:14</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 35:10; Exod 35:11</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32; Exod 39:33</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:34; Exod 40:35</span> ] discussed in detail above, however, I feel that every effort should be made to distinguish between “tent of meeting” and “tabernacle.” But if this means that the translation draws too much attention to competing ideas at the expense of a natural flow in the story, then adjustment will be necessary."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.15.1","book":"realia","title":"Tent of Meeting","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹהֶל, מוֹעֵד","transliteration":"’ohel, ’ohel mo‘ed","references":["Exod 33:7","Exod 33:7","Exod 33:7","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:8","Exod 33:9","Exod 33:9","Exod 33:10","Exod 33:10","Exod 33:11","Num 11:16","Num 11:24","Num 11:26","Num 12:4","Num 12:5","Deut 31:14","Deut 31:14","Deut 31:15","Deut 31:15","Josh 18:1","Josh 19:51","2 Chr 1:3","2 Chr 1:6","2 Chr 1:13","2 Chr 5:5","2 Chr 5:5"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["If Osborn is correct in his conclusion that there were two different tents (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15 Tent of Meeting and Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15&gt;</a>), then the dimensions given in the Pentateuch refer to the Tabernacle, and we have no actual description given for the Tent of Meeting.

decoding=\"async\"></figure>The Hebrew and Greek terms listed above can change in meaning depending on the context. The translator should pay careful attention to the context, which will generally indicate what meaning is in view. For example, the Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> may be used to indicate the entire Tabernacle complex (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:8</span>) or the Tabernacle proper, that is, the tent in the courtyard which contained the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:1</span>). Similarly, the Hebrew word <em>miqdash</em> sometimes means the Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 20:3</span>), sometimes the Most Holy Place (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 16:33</span>), and sometimes the whole Tabernacle complex (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 25:8</span>).","The Hebrew word <em>’ohel</em>, which means “tent” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.2 Tent&lt;REALIA:3.2&gt;</a>), can indicate the Tabernacle proper (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 26:36</span>) or, as explained above (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">3.15 Tent of Meeting and Tabernacle&lt;REALIA:3.15&gt;</a>), the Tent of Meeting.","In some languages “Tabernacle” may be rendered “largest tent in which God lived,” “large tent for worshiping God,” or “holy tent.” In selecting a proper designation, it is important to indicate that the function of the Tabernacle was essentially the same as that of the Temple; there was only a difference of construction and not a difference of use or of religious relevance. Refer to the discussion at 3.14.1 “Jewish Temple.”","Osborn makes the following comments concerning the translation of “Tabernacle”: “A few recent translations have broken from the traditional rendering of ‘tabernacle’ and simply translate it as ‘Dwelling.’ <em>The Translator’s Old Testament</em> (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOT</abbr>) uses the word ‘Shrine,’ which is perhaps a bit more appropriate for what was to become the wilderness dwelling of Yahweh. Either term, of course, could still refer to the tent within the enclosure or to the entire structure including the tent. Both terms suggest, however, something different from the more permanent Temple of Solomon, which seems to have influenced the priestly description of the tabernacle.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32; Exod 40:2; Exod 40:6; Exod 40:29; 1 Chr 6:17</span>: The Hebrew in these verses combines the terms <em>mishkan</em> and <em>’ohel mo‘ed</em>, which <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> renders “the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.” In the three references in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:0</span>, it is probable that <em>mishkan</em> refers to the inner tent, made of the frames and four coverings, while <em>’ohel mo‘ed</em> refers to the entire Tabernacle complex. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:32</span> the two terms are used for the same thing, the second term explaining the first one. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> uses only one expression for both terms in this verse: “the Tent of the LORD’s presence.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> is better with “the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.” Another way to express this is “the sacred tent, where the people met with the LORD.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:2; Heb 9:11; Rev 15:5</span>: These verses speak about a sacred tent, using the same Greek word <em>skēnē</em> that refers to the tent in the wilderness (for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:5</span>). However, in these passages the text is speaking of a heavenly or spiritual counterpart (actually, original) of the physical tent. Where possible, the translation should keep the same word to render <em>skēnē</em>, whether it refers to the physical tent or its heavenly counterpart.","The following is adapted from the comments in <em>A Handbook on The Revelation to John</em> (pages 226-227) at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 15:5</span>: There is some uncertainty concerning what is meant by the compound genitive “the temple of the tent of witness” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> /<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>). This literal rendering is quite ambiguous, but the average reader probably understands it to mean that in the tent of witness there is a temple. There are three possible meanings for this expression: (1) “the tent of witness” and “the temple” refer to the same thing, so it may be rendered “the temple, that is, the Witness Tent” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>); (2) “the Witness Tent in the Temple” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">FRCL</abbr>, Brazilian common language version); (3) “the sanctuary in the Witness Tent” (so <em>The Translator’s New Testament</em> [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">TNT</abbr>], <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, Brc, Phillips [<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Phps</abbr>]). In favor of the last interpretation—which is the one that is recommended—is the fact that the word translated “temple” (<em>naos</em> in Greek) is the special term for the inner sanctuary of the Temple, as contrasted with the Temple’s large worship area (<em>hieron</em> in Greek). The inner sanctuary (in which the Covenant Box was kept) was separated by a heavy curtain from the worship area, in which were located the altar of incense and the table on which were placed daily the loaves of bread offered to God. This was also the design of the Tabernacle (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 40:1–Exod 40:33</span>). It seems best, then, to translate here “the sanctuary [or, most holy place] that was in the Witness Tent” or “… that was in the Tabernacle.” A translation should use here and in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Acts 7:44</span> the name for Tabernacle most often used in the Old Testament."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֹהֶל, מוֹעֵד","transliteration":"’ohel, ’ohel

In the Tabernacle the Holy Place measured 10 by 20 cubits (5 by 10 meters; 16.5 by 33 feet), while in the Temple it was 20 cubits by 40 cubits (10 by 20 meters; 33 by 66 feet).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["In some languages the outer room of the sanctuary may be referred to simply as “the first room of the Tabernacle/Temple” or “the first holy room of the Tabernacle/Temple.” “Holy Place” may also be rendered “taboo place [or, room]” or possibly “restricted place,” meaning that only the priests could enter it.","There may be complications in speaking of the first part of the sanctuary as being the Holy Place, since in some languages the word “place” only indicates a location and not an enclosure. Therefore “the Holy Place” must be rendered in these languages as “the Holy Room.” Other possible renderings are “the Place/Room where God is [present]” and “the Place/Room of God.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 20:3</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> has “the place where I [the LORD] am worshiped.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 21:23</span>: The use of the plural “my sanctuaries” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) here is surprising and troubling to scholars. Some have suggested that it is evidence of a time when there were several shrines where the Israelites worshiped, but others see it as a reference to “my sanctuary and all its contents” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr>). This interpretation is essentially the one followed by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> as well as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, and should be adopted in the receptor language. A literal rendering of “my sanctuaries” would be misleading, and the singular “my sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">LB</abbr>) does not accurately reflect the text.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 9:1–Heb 9:2</span>: “Sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) in verse 1 is literally “holy place” (<em>hagion</em> in Greek). Here it refers to the entire place of worship. It is also called a “tent” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; <em>skēnē</em> in Greek) in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Heb 8:2</span>. A different Greek word (<em>hagia</em>) is used for the Holy Place in 9.2 (literally “holy places”), which is the outer part of the sanctuary. The text is, however, complicated by the fact that the same Greek word for “tent” is used to describe the whole building (8.2), the Holy Place (9.2), and the Most Holy Place (9.3). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> solves the problem by beginning 9.2 with “There was a tent set up with two rooms.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> is similar: “There was a tent which comprised two compartments.” The writer was not interested in the details of any particular sanctuary, but the details that he does give are consistent with a general picture of a large room divided

The general description that follows reflects the opinion of most scholars, and it should be sufficient to assist the translator in his task. The individual parts will be described separately.","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["The Tabernacle complex consisted of two main structures. There was an outer wall made of poles and curtains. This defined the borders of the courtyard. Entry into the courtyard was through an opening in the eastern side of the outer wall. The Hebrew word <em>mishkan</em> is sometimes used to indicate the entire complex. More often, however, it means the second structure, the large tent that stood inside the enclosed complex. It is for this latter structure that we use the word Tabernacle here.","The Tabernacle was basically a tent spread over a framework. The framework was made of a series of individual frames that were joined together. A frame was made of five pieces of acacia wood. Two long uprights were joined at the top, the middle, and near the bottom by crosspieces or rungs. The ends of the uprights extended below the bottom rung. These two extensions, technically called tenons, fit into corresponding holes in a heavy silver base, which was the same width as the frame. The frames on their bases were set side-by-side, forming a wall. This frame wall was then made stable by inserting bars through three lines of rings that were attached to the frames. There were three such frame walls; the east side had no wall but only an entrance of curtains hung from poles.","The top and sides of the Tabernacle were covered by four layers of different materials. The inner layer, which would have been visible on the inside above and through the openings in the frames, was made of embroidered linen (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.5.3.7 Linen&lt;REALIA:1.5.3.7&gt;</a> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.5.3.11 Embroidered cloth, needlework&lt;REALIA:1.5.3.11&gt;</a>). This layer stretched out over the top of the frame from one side to the other. In this way it formed the ceiling and hung down on both sides to within about 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the ground. Over top of the entire structure were spread three layers intended to protect the frames, the linen curtains, and the implements inside the Tabernacle. While the outer layers were not decorated (except that one was dyed red) and would not have been particularly attractive, they were chosen for their ability to protect against rain, even the relatively small amounts that fall in the Sinai region. Spreading the four layers over the top had the effect of giving the Tabernacle a flat roof, not sloped, and thus it would have resembled a box. The outer layers were longer than the linen layer and hung down to the ground. One end was left open as an entrance.","A number of the objects for the Tabernacle were constructed according to the same basic pattern. For example, the top coverings of the sanctuary were made of two pieces and joined together with a system of hooks and rings. Similarly, the curtain in front of the Most Holy Place was hung on hooks by means of rings sewn into the fabric, and the same method was used to hang the curtains that formed the outer boundary of the courtyard as well as the curtain that closed the entrance to the Holy Place. All of these curtains were held up in the same basic way, by wooden posts that stood in heavy metal bases. Once a translator has determined the proper words to use for ring, hook, post, base, and curtain, the same words should be employed throughout.","Several of the items in the Tabernacle were made of acacia wood (<em>shitah</em> in Hebrew).","Even in languages where there is no particular difficulty in translating the individual parts of the Tabernacle, it will be good to include some kind of illustration or diagram."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"3.15.2.3.1","book":"realia","title":"Frames, boards","depth":4,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"קֶרֶשׁ","transliteration":"qeresh","references":["Exod 26:15","Exod 26:16","Exod 26:16","Exod 26:17","Exod 26:17","Exod 26:18","Exod 26:18","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:19","Exod 26:20","Exod 26:21","Exod 26:21","Exod 26:22","Exod 26:23","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:25","Exod 26:26","Exod 26:27","Exod 26:27","Exod 26:28","Exod 26:29","Exod 35:11","Exod 36:20","Exod 36:21","Exod 36:21","Exod 36:22","Exod 36:22","Exod 36:23","Exod 36:23","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:24","Exod 36:25","Exod 36:26","Exod 36:26","Exod 36:27","Exod 36:28","Exod 36:30","Exod 36:30","Exod 36:31","Exod 36:32","Exod 36:32","Exod 36:33","Exod 36:34","Exod 39:33","Exod 40:18","Num 3:36","Num 4:31","Ezek 27:6"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\" alt=\"UBS-0021_tabernacle_frame_and_base_en.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>These parts of the Tabernacle have traditionally been understood as solid pieces of wood.

A suggestion that is now generally accepted is that the Hebrew word <em>qeresh</em> indicates a kind of “frame” made of wood. The outer dimensions would be the same, but such frames would be lighter, they would make the structure cooler, and they would allow the embroidered inner curtain to be seen on the inside. This suggestion is now included in most modern translations and is recommended here.

Because of these extended meanings, it is important to choose an expression that can, if at all possible, support these additional meanings.","The Greek word <em>xulon</em> is literally “wood.” Outside the New Testament <em>xulon</em> often refers to a gallows; in the New Testament contexts that speak of capital punishment, the reference is to the cross on which Jesus was crucified.

The second Hebrew word, <em>moshkoth</em>, appears only here in Scripture.

(Some of the references are to the creatures themselves, but the places listed above refer to physical representations of those creatures.) The only consistent information given to describe cherubim (the Hebrew plural of <em>kruv</em>) is that they had wings. In some places they have one face, in others four faces. Sometimes they are said to have two legs, at other times four legs. Three-dimensional statues of them were part of the atonement lid that covered the Covenant Box (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1.1 Mercy seat, atonement cover, atonement lid&lt;REALIA:4.1.1&gt;</a> and the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1 Covenant Box, Ark of the Covenant&lt;REALIA:4.1&gt;</a>).

Their wings were extended, with one wing of each meeting a wing of the other in the center of the room.","Representations of cherubim were also embroidered on different cloth items in the Tabernacle. In the Temple, where walls replaced the curtains, similar figures were carved in relief on the walls.","The cherubim serve in Scripture as symbols of God’s majesty and presence.

Translators must not give the impression that the cherub is a variant of some locally known large bird. Even though the cherub’s distinguishing characteristic was the fact of having wings, “winged animal” does not do justice to the composite nature of this ancient symbol. A phrase like “flying being” may be meaningless, and “flying thing” may be equated with anything from an insect to an airplane.

Pagan altars","In the entries that follow, different altars are described. However, in many verses it is uncertain exactly which altar is intended. This is especially true of events in the Tabernacle complex or the Temple, where either the altar for sacrifices or the incense altar may be intended. Many languages have a generic term for an altar or a ceremonial platform that can serve many purposes. Where there is no term for a place of sacrificial offerings, translators may need to use a descriptive phrase or borrow a term.

A number of modern cultures have elevated structures for sacrificing animals or for offering gifts to a deity. Sometimes this will be a stone or wood platform or table. Be sure that the translation makes it clear that the sacrifice is being offered to God.","A descriptive equivalent of “altar” occurs in some languages as “place where gifts are given to God.” Several other models are “place/plat­form/hearth where people offer sacrifices,” “bed/platform for [killing and] offering sacrifices,” and “[hearth] stones for/of sacrificing things.” In some contexts it may be necessary to add a phrase such as “where sacrifices are burned to God” or “where incense is burned to honor God.” Other possible translations include “thing on which [sacred] offerings are placed” and “place of sacrifice.” In most passages the actual form of the altar is not in focus; the important fact is that it was a place where sacrifices were made.","Warning: In some South American languages a transliterated form of “altar” (or its Spanish or Portuguese equivalent) may occur. This word is often “borrowed” with a restricted meaning, sometimes referring to the shrine of a particular saint, or to the front section of a church, or to a patriotic shrine. When a borrowed word of this kind occurs, always check carefully what meaning it has for speakers of the receptor language in order to know whether or not it is suitable.","Similarly, translators may be tempted to use a transliteration of the word “altar” because that is what is used locally in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, or other church. As in the case of the term “priest,” it is recommended that this Christian term not be used as the basis for Old Testament translation, because it has a very different theological significance.

The Hebrew phrase that describes it in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> is <em>ma‘aseh resheth</em>, which is literally “net-work.” The exact position and function of this mesh are disputed. Some scholars have suggested that it was simply wrapped around the bottom half of the altar as a decoration, perhaps also serving to strengthen the wooden frame of the altar; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> a as “cover the bottom half of the altar with a decorative bronze grating.” Most, however, understand it as it is described above. Its placement on or in the altar was related in some way to the rim or ledge, which went around the top of the altar (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.2.2 Tabernacle altar&lt;REALIA:4.2.2&gt;</a>).","“So that the net shall extend halfway down the altar” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:5</span> b in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is literally “and the net will be until half of the altar.” This does not indicate whether it means halfway down or “halfway up the altar” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). Most translations have “halfway up,” suggesting that the grating was placed in some way at the lower half of the altar. But <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr> suggest that this grating was near the top. It is probably better for translators to follow this interpretation.","As can be seen from an overview of various translations, it is possible to translate <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 38:4; Exod 38:5</span> and the parallel passage in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4; Exod 27:7</span> without actually leaving the reader with a clear picture of how the grating, rim, and altar were related. While it is true that the functions of the rim and the grating are disputed, a clear description of one feasible option is to be preferred to a rendering that is meaningless to the reader. The following model is given in <em>A Handbook on Exodus</em> (page 635):","4 Make a bronze grating, like a strainer, and attach a bronze ring at each of its four corners. 5 Then place the grating under the rim that goes around the altar, so that it extends halfway down inside the altar.","Another possible model is:","5 Build a rim around the altar near the top, and hang a bronze grating from it extending halfway down inside the altar. At each of the four corners of the grating attach a bronze ring.","<strong>Rings and poles</strong>: <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 27:4</span> says that bronze rings were to be put on the “ends” or “edges” of the grating. Verse 7 describes the placing of the poles into “the rings, so that the poles shall be upon the two sides of the altar” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). The Hebrew seems to indicate that there is only one set of rings, those attached to the grating, and that they were used to carry the entire altar. The placement of the rings will depend on the translator’s understanding of the grating as discussed above. If the “grating” is understood as a mesh going around the outside of the altar, then the rings are simply attached to the mesh. If, on the other hand, the “grating” is understood to be horizontal and sitting inside the altar, the rings projected through the corners of the altar so that the poles could be put through them.","The poles were placed into the rings for carrying the altar, and they were probably removed after it had been set into place. Where a language distinguishes between installing an object permanently or temporarily, the latter option is the correct one here.

The comments of Noordtzij (page 144) may be helpful: “The use of censers for the burning of incense here [<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 16:6</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Num 16:17</span> ] has led some to conclude that this author did not know of the golden altar of incense of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:1–Exod 30:10</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:25–Exod 37:29</span>, but this is based on a misunderstanding. The altar was used for the daily burning of incense in order to close off, as it were, the most holy place from the Holy Place by means of a cloud of incense, so that the proximity of the Lord who dwelled above the ark would not be dangerous to the priests. But the censer was used when the priest (in Israel this was only the high priest!) approached the ark itself (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 16:12; Lev 16:13</span>).” However, see also the comments below at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan&lt;REALIA:4.4.5&gt;</a>.","The incense altar of the Tabernacle was carried by poles inserted through rings attached to its sides (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 30:4; Exod 30:5</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 37:27; Exod 37:28</span>). See the discussion at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.1 Covenant Box, Ark of the Covenant&lt;REALIA:4.1&gt;</a> above. Unlike the poles used to carry the Covenant Box, the poles for other objects, such as the incense altar, were removed after the piece of furniture was set in its appointed place.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 65:3</span>: The exact meaning of the literal clause “they burn incense on bricks” is not clear. What is clear is that the prophet is speaking against some pagan practice adopted by the people of Israel. Translators may wish to follow <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>, and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> by rendering “bricks” as “altars of brick” (similarly <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> is even more explicit with “pagan altars.” The main point of the prophecy is that the incense was being burned in a forbidden way, in a location other than the incense altar in the Temple.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9; Rev 8:3; Rev 8:5; Rev 9:13; Rev 11:1; Rev 14:18; Rev 16:7</span>: There are eight references to an altar in Revelation, but commentators are divided as to whether John is speaking of the same altar each time and which altar he intends in any given verse. A comment by Mounce (page 157) on <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9</span> is attractive: “It is probably unimportant to conjecture whether the altar is the altar of burnt offering or the altar of incense. The theme of sacrifice would suggest the former, and the prayers which rise (vs. 10) seem to indicate the latter. There is no reason why in John’s vision the two should not blend together as one.” The distinction will be important, however, if a translator has no general word for altar that can retain the ambiguity of Revelation and include both types of altar. Where a translator must choose between a word meaning “altar for burning animal sacrifices” and a word meaning “incense altar,” there are two basic options: 1) choose one of the two words and use it consistently throughout the book, or 2) choose the word according to the context.","In the book of Revelation an altar is first mentioned at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Rev 6:9</span>; however, it is referred to as if both it and its location are already well known, or the author assumes that the readers are aware that they are in a Temple-like setting. This kind of reference should be retained, even though readers of the translation may not yet be acquainted with it. The word chosen should make it clear that this altar is dedicated to God."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מִזְבֵּחַ, מִקְטָר, קְטֹרֶת","transliteration":"mizbeach (miqtar qetoreth)","references":["Exod 30:1","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 39:38","Exod 40:5","Exod 40:26","Lev 4:7","Num 4:11","1 Kgs 6:20","1 Kgs 6:22","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 6:34","1 Chr 28:18","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 26:16","2 Chr 26:19","Ezek 41:22"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"מְקַטֶּרֶת","transliteration":"meqatereth","references":["2 Chr 30:14"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"לְבֵנָה","transliteration":"lvenah","references":["Isa 65:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֻׁלְחָן","transliteration":"shulchan","references":["Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"θυμιατήριον","transliteration":"thumiatērion","references":["Heb 9:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"θυσιαστήριον, θυμίαμα","transliteration":"thusiastērion (tou thumiamatos), thumiama","references":["Luke 1:11","Rev 6:9","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:5","Rev 9:13","Rev 14:18","Rev 16:7","1 Macc 1:21","1 Macc 4:49","1 Macc 4:50","2 Macc 2:5"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 30:1","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:15","Exod 37:25","Exod 39:38","Exod 40:5","Exod 40:26","Lev 4:7","Num 4:11","1 Kgs 6:20","1 Kgs 6:22","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 6:34","1 Chr 28:18","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 26:16","2 Chr 26:19","Ezek 41:22","2 Chr 30:14","Isa 65:3","Ezek 44:16","Heb 9:4","Luke 1:11","Rev 6:9","Rev 8:3","Rev 8:5","Rev 9:13","Rev 14:18","Rev 16:7","1 Macc 1:21","1 Macc 4:49","1 Macc 4:50","2 Macc 2:5"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.3","book":"realia","title":"Furniture of the Tabernacle and Temple","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.3.1","label":"4.3.1 Tabernacle: Washstand, basin, bowl","text":"4.3.1 Tabernacle: Washstand, basin, bowl"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.2","label":"4.3.2 Temple: Sea, tank","text":"4.3.2 Temple: Sea, tank"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.3","label":"4.3.3 Temple: Movable stand, cart, stand, base","text":"4.3.3 Temple: Movable stand, cart, stand, base"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.4","label":"4.3.4 Lampstand, menorah","text":"4.3.4 Lampstand, menorah"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.5","label":"4.3.5 Table for consecrated bread","text":"4.3.5 Table for consecrated bread"},{"target":"REALIA:4.3.6","label":"4.3.6 Tables for preparing sacrificial victims","text":"4.3.6 Tables for preparing sacrificial victims"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"Some of the Tabernacle furniture was preserved or duplicated in the Temple built by Solomon.

One problem in understanding <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ezek 40:39; Ezek 40:40; Ezek 40:41; Ezek 40:42; Ezek 40:43</span> has to do with the number of tables. Most translations understand that there were eight tables altogether, four inside the vestibule and four outside (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “41 Altogether there were eight tables on which the animals to be sacrificed were killed: four inside the room and four out in the courtyard. 42 The four tables in the annex, used to prepare the offerings to be burned whole, were of cut stone …”). However, some understand that there were twelve tables altogether (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> “41 So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. 42 There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings …”).","Verse 43 presents the translator with a couple of interrelated problems. The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>shfatayim</em> is not certain. With a small change of its first letter, some versions take it to mean a “ledges/shelves” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>). Others understand it to mean “hooks” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>). In addition to its meaning, its location is also problematic. The Hebrew text (in the middle of describing the tables) says it was “inside all around.” If this means all around the tables, it makes little sense (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> “Shelves … were attached all around the inside”). How can we visualize shelves around the inside of the table? <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> simply ignores the word for “inside” and says “Ledges 3 inches wide ran around the edge of the tables.” Some have avoided the problem by assuming that “all around” refers to the walls of the vestibule rather than the tables (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> “All around the walls of this room was a three inch shelf”). It is difficult to see the purpose of such a narrow shelf, if indeed it served any purpose at all. Rendering <em>shfatayim</em> as “hooks” solves only part of the problems. The length of 75 millimeters (3 inches) would be reasonable for a hook. The problem of “all around inside” the tables is the same for hooks as it is for shelves. However, if “Hooks were anchored in the wall all around” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>), then we can imagine several possible purposes for such hooks. They could have been used for hanging the work implements, or (as suggested by Jewish tradition) they could have been for hanging the freshly-slaughtered victim while its skin was removed (something that is difficult to do while it lies on a table). The form of the word <em>shfatayim</em> suggests something doubled, so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> has “double-pronged hooks.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שֻׁלְחָן","transliteration":"shulchan","references":["Exod 25:23","Exod 25:27","Exod 25:28","Exod 25:30","Exod 26:35","Exod 26:35","Exod 26:35","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:13","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:14","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:16","Exod 39:36","Exod 40:4","Exod 40:22","Exod 40:24","Lev 24:6","Num 3:31","Num 4:7","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","1 Chr 28:16","2 Chr 4:8","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 13:11","2 Chr 29:18","Ezek 23:41","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:42","Ezek 40:43","Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16","Mal 1:7","Mal 1:12"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שְׁפַתַּיִם","transliteration":"shfatayim","references":["Ezek 40:43"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 25:23","Exod 25:27","Exod 25:28","Exod 25:30","Exod 26:35","Exod 30:27","Exod 31:8","Exod 35:13","Exod 37:10","Exod 37:14","Exod 37:15","Exod 37:16","Exod 39:36","Exod 40:4","Exod 40:22","Exod 40:24","Lev 24:6","Num 3:31","Num 4:7","1 Kgs 7:48","1 Chr 28:16","2 Chr 4:8","2 Chr 4:19","2 Chr 13:11","2 Chr 29:18","Ezek 23:41","Ezek 40:39","Ezek 40:40","Ezek 40:41","Ezek 40:42","Ezek 40:43","Ezek 41:22","Ezek 44:16","Mal 1:7","Mal 1:12"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.4","book":"realia","title":"Tabernacle and Temple implements","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.4.1","label":"4.4.1 Pan, pot, pail","text":"4.4.1 Pan, pot, pail"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.2","label":"4.4.2 Fork","text":"4.4.2 Fork"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.3","label":"4.4.3 Tongs","text":"4.4.3 Tongs"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.4","label":"4.4.4 Basin, bowl","text":"4.4.4 Basin, bowl"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.5","label":"4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan","text":"4.4.5 Small shovel, firepan"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.6","label":"4.4.6 Large shovel, scraper","text":"4.4.6 Large shovel, scraper"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.7","label":"4.4.7 Censer","text":"4.4.7 Censer"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.8","label":"4.4.8 Plate","text":"4.4.8 Plate"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.9","label":"4.4.9 Incense dish","text":"4.4.9 Incense dish"},{"target":"REALIA:4.4.10","label":"4.4.10 Jar for the wine offering, libation vessel","text":"4.4.10 Jar for the wine offering, libation vessel"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"The sacrificial cult was a fairly messy business, and the work at the altar required a number of special implements to make things move more efficiently.

The belt was an integral part of the ephod; it was wrapped around the waist and tied either in the front or the back (see also the discussion below). The top of the ephod was at about the bottom of the ribcage. According to a tradition preserved by Josephus (<em>Antiquities</em> III 7, 5), the ephod had a length of one cubit (about 50 centimeters or 20 inches). This would mean that it extended approximately to the middle of the upper leg. The dimensions of the ephod are not given in Scripture.","In order to gain a better picture of the structure of this ephod, it is helpful to consider it together with the breastpiece (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5.5 Sacred pocket, breastpiece&lt;REALIA:4.5.5&gt;</a>). According to one interpretation, the shoulder straps of the ephod were attached in the back and in the front of the ephod, and the breastpiece was attached to these straps in the front by gold rings. This is demonstrated in the illustration at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5 High Priest’s clothing&lt;REALIA:4.5&gt;</a>. According to another interpretation, the shoulder straps of the ephod did not reach the belt at the top of the ephod. The space between the end of the straps and the belt (about 25 centimeters or 10 inches) was taken up by the breastpiece. On the four corners of the breastpiece were sewn gold rings. The lower two rings were tied with a blue thread to corresponding rings in the belt of the ephod. The upper rings of the breastpiece were connected to the ends of the shoulder straps by means of small gold chains. On the end of each shoulder strap was a kind of clasp consisting of a precious stone in a gold setting. Engraved on these stones were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. It was to these devices that the other ends of the gold chains were attached. See the illustrations here and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.5.5 Sacred pocket, breastpiece&lt;REALIA:4.5.5&gt;</a>.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["“Ephod” is a transliteration of the Hebrew word <em>’efod</em> and is perhaps the most difficult piece of the priestly clothing to translate. In some languages there will be a word for an item of clothing corresponding in design (if not in purpose) to the ephod. However, in some cases the word may not be usable because it designates something used only by women. In other cases a word for a workman’s apron may be inappropriate because its primary purpose is to protect the clothing. This was not the purpose of the ephod, which was the most elaborate and expensive item in the High Priest’s wardrobe. Almost all English versions transliterate <em>’efod</em>, but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr> has simply “apron” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr> translates “[sacred] apron.” In other languages it may be possible to say “priestly apron.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 28:8</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 39:5</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> has the phrase “the skilfully woven band.” This band or belt seems to have been made with the same material as the ephod and attached to its corners so that it could be tied. The use of the singular does not necessarily mean that there was only one belt. The term may have been used in a collective sense. The Hebrew word here simply means “girdle,” “waistband,” or “belt.” The idea of “skilfully woven” is therefore omitted in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NEB</abbr> as well as in many non-English versions, and may also be left out of the receptor-language rendering. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> has “The waistband on the <em>ephod</em>.”","<em>Other meanings of ’efod</em>: In a number of the passages listed above, the word <em>’efod</em> describes something other than an item of the High Priest’s clothing. In most (some would say all) cases it still indicates an item of clothing, probably a kind of vest or apron tied around the upper abdomen. See <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:18; 1 Sam 22:18; 2 Sam 6:14</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Chr 15:27</span>, where the Hebrew phrase <em>’efod bad</em> is used; this phrase is literally “linen ephod” or “cloth ephod.” The renderings of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:18</span> (“sacred linen apron”) and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 6:14</span> (“linen cloth around his waist”) may serve as models.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 8:27</span>: The exact nature of the “ephod” made by Gideon remains uncertain. Because he collected a large quantity of gold before he made it, many have thought it to be a kind of “idol” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, International Children’s Bible, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). However, even here it is possible that a copy of the priestly apron is intended; gold was a major component of the priestly garment, and some of Gideon’s gold could have been used to pay the skilled workers to make the ephod. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> says “holy vest,” but most versions simply have the transliteration “ephod” (for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>). If no explanation is given, however, the average reader will probably associate it with the object of the same name first mentioned in Exodus. It seems best, then, to decide between “idol/image/statue” and “priestly apron”; or, if “ephod” is kept, to include a footnote indicating the possible meanings. The <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr> note on this verse is a good model: “The <em>ephod</em> may designate here either a receptacle for the sacred lots, used for divination, or the statue of a god.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 17:5; Judg 18:14; Judg 18:18; Judg 18:18; Judg 18:20</span>; and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 3:4</span>, the ephods mentioned may well have been sacred clothing similar in purpose and perhaps in form to the ephod of the High Priest. However, both Micah’s ephod in Judges and the one mentioned in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Hos 3:4</span> were not the High Priest’ ephod. These ephods are associated in their contexts with illicit worship."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵפֹד, אֲפֻדָּה","transliteration":"’efod, ’afudah","references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:6","Exod 28:8","Exod 28:12","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:25","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:31","Exod 29:5","Exod 29:5","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:2","Exod 39:5","Exod 39:7","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:18","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:22","Lev 8:7","Lev 8:7","Num 34:23","Judg 8:27","Judg 17:5","Judg 18:14","Judg 18:17","Judg 18:18","Judg 18:20","1 Sam 2:18","1 Sam 2:28","1 Sam 14:3","1 Sam 21:10","1 Sam 22:18","1 Sam 23:6","1 Sam 23:9","1 Sam 30:7","1 Sam 30:7","2 Sam 6:14","1 Chr 15:27","Isa 30:22","Hos 3:4"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"ἐπωμίς","transliteration":"epōmis","references":["Sir 45:8"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:6","Exod 28:8","Exod 28:12","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:25","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:27","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:31","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:2","Exod 39:5","Exod 39:7","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:18","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:20","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:22","Lev 8:7","Num 34:23","Judg 8:27","Judg 17:5","Judg 18:14","Judg 18:17","Judg 18:18","Judg 18:20","1 Sam 2:18","1 Sam 2:28","1 Sam 14:3","1 Sam 21:10","1 Sam 22:18","1 Sam 23:6","1 Sam 23:9","1 Sam 30:7","2 Sam 6:14","1 Chr 15:27","Isa 30:22","Hos 3:4","Sir 45:8"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.5.5","book":"realia","title":"Sacred pocket, breastpiece","depth":2,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֹשֶׁן","transliteration":"choshen","references":["Exod 25:7","Exod 28:4","Exod 28:15","Exod 28:22","Exod 28:23","Exod 28:23","Exod 28:24","Exod 28:26","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:28","Exod 28:29","Exod 28:30","Exod 29:5","Exod 35:9","Exod 35:27","Exod 39:8","Exod 39:9","Exod 39:15","Exod 39:16","Exod 39:17","Exod 39:19","Exod 39:21","Exod 39:21","Lev 8:8","Lev 8:8"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\" alt=\"OAI-0050_highpriest_breastpiece.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The breastpiece was a piece of embroidered cloth worn by the High Priest over the center of his chest.

While the Hebrew word can include the element of elevation, this is not its primary focus. More important is that it was a site where religious rites and sacrifices—primarily pagan—took place. In most passages where this word occurs, it is best to make explicit that these sites were “places of worship” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) and that they were generally associated with pagan cults. Some translations have rendered <em>bamah</em> as “sanctuary” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 11:7</span>) or “place of sacrifice” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 11:7</span>). If the context does not make it clear that the text is speaking of pagan sacrifice, then it will be necessary to expand the translation to clarify this. Thus <abbr class=\"bible-version\">SPCL</abbr> usually adds the word “pagan” or even expands to “high places of pagan cultic worship” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Kgs 3:2</span>). Something like this is recommended.","If there is a word in the receptor language for a “shrine” or a place where offerings are placed for fetishes, this may be appropriate. Where such a word is lacking, translators can always say “places where various gods are worshiped.”","In a few passages the word <em>bamah</em> indicates an Israelite place of worship. See, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 9:12; 1 Sam 9:13; 1 Sam 9:14; 1 Sam 9:19; 1 Sam 9:25; 1 Sam 10:5; 1 Sam 10:13; 1 Kgs 3:2; 1 Kgs 3:3; 1 Kgs 3:4</span>. It is significant that these examples come before the dedication of the Temple by Solomon. The later writings of the Old Testament condemn not only pagan worship at the “high places,” but also Israelite worship at any place except the Temple at Jerusalem. In these later books, in fact, “high place” seems to indicate any sanctuary not recognized by the official authorities. Because of this tendency, it is not recommended that one standard translation, such as “pagan places of worship,” be adopted except where the context clearly indicates that this is the case. A translation such as “country temple” for an unauthorized worship place should be avoided, lest readers think that there were temples in the rural areas similar to the Temple in Jerusalem. “Country shrine” may be a good neutral expression, but perhaps the best translation, at least in those passages where unauthorized worship is condemned, is “illegitimate places of worship” or “places where people were not supposed to offer sacrifices.” Translators will normally be able to employ the same word or phrase whether the text is speaking of Israelite or pagan worship."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בָּמָה","transliteration":"bamah","references":["Lev 26:30","Num 33:52","1 Sam 9:12","1 Sam 9:13","1 Sam 9:14","1 Sam 9:19","1 Sam 9:25","1

the burial of the dead. Since much of the land of Israel, especially in the hilly regions, has little topsoil, tombs were often hewn out of bedrock. In some cases natural caves were used for burial. The entrance to a tomb was closed with a stone (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.8.1.1 Stone for closing a tomb&lt;REALIA:4.8.1.1&gt;</a>).","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Death is a universal experience, and all languages and cultures have words to express the disposal of a dead body. In a number of languages it is important to distinguish clearly between a grave (a hole in the ground in which a corpse is placed) and a tomb (a construction built above the surface of the ground for housing one or more corpses). In some contexts, however, it may be better to use a more generic expression, for example, “places where people are buried” or “places where corpses are placed.”","In some passages the word “grave” is used as a symbol for death. Translators should consider whether the physical burial place is in focus or rather the fact that a person has died. In the latter case, it may be better to use a term indicating “death.” This will be true especially in poetic passages. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 3:22</span> is literally “who rejoicing unto joy are glad when they find a grave,” but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “They are not happy till they are dead and buried.” <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 5:26</span> is literally “You will come to the grave at an old age,” but <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “you will live to a ripe old age.”","Certain verses speak of “graves” in the plural. Here it will often be appropriate to use a word like “graveyard” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:32</span>) or “cemetery.”","In the upper levels of Israelite society burial was often done in two stages. In the first stage the body was either laid on a kind of shelf inside a burial chamber or it was placed in a large box called a sarcophagus (“flesh eater”) in English. After about a year, when the flesh had rotted, the bones were moved to a designated place in the chamber. By New Testament times the bones were being placed into an ossuary (“bone box”). These practices gave rise to two expressions in the Hebrew language: “he lay down with his fathers” and “he was gathered to his fathers.” In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Chr 16:14</span>, the place where the body was laid out (<em>mishkav</em> in Hebrew) is referred to in the burial of King Asa of Judah. Some translations render the word as “bier” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>; see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">4.8.4 Bier, coffin&lt;REALIA:4.8.4&gt;</a>), but the structure of the verse indicates that Asa’s body was taken into the tomb and laid in its permanent place, that is, on a shelf in the tomb. The rendering of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr> gives the sense better with “resting-place.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 13:6</span>: The meaning of the Hebrew word <em>tsrichim</em> in this verse is uncertain. Some versions understand it to mean “tombs” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">ITCL</abbr>). These would be cave-like structures hewn out of the rock. Others use a more generic term, such as “pits” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>) or “vaults” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>). Some have thought this word is related to a Hebrew word meaning “stronghold” or “tower” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:46</span>, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Judg 9:49</span>, but this meaning does not seem to fit the context here.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 23:29</span> the Greek word <em>mnēmeion</em> may also be understood as referring to monuments built as memorials to people who have died. Here it may be translated “monuments to the dead.” This is also its meaning in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 11:47</span>. The Latin word <em>monumentum</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">3 Macc 2:16</span> may be understood in the same way.","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 5:2</span>  it is important to avoid a term that would designate merely graves, for the demoniac who met Jesus was not living down in graves in the ground, but had found some habitation either in burial caves or in tombs constructed above ground."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בַּיִת","transliteration":"bayith","references":["Isa

In most languages “sackcloth” is described as “coarse cloth” and sometimes as “heavy cloth.” It will often be best to clarify the relation between these clothes and mourning; for example, “clothes that show someone is mourning for the dead.”","In some languages there may exist an equivalent symbol of mourning, such as body painting, smearing ashes over the face or chest, carrying objects such as bags symbolizing a needy widow’s mourning, or wearing a cord of mourning around the neck. There are dangers as well as advantages in such a cultural translation. Particular aspects of the Israelite culture are lost, and there may be undesirable meanings associated with the local practice. Whenever this is done, all of its ramifications should be checked carefully. Generally it will be preferable to use the Israelite custom, with a footnote explaining its meaning or providing the equivalent custom. A footnote might read “Mourning clothes were coarse pieces of cloth sewed together from woven goat or camel hair.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 14:2</span> does not specifically mention sackcloth but speaks of “mourning clothes.” It was the Jewish custom to tear the outer garment as a sign of despair or sadness. However, this verse indicates something more than just tearing the clothing. For the literal clause “put on mourning clothes,” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr> have “Put on funeral clothes.” Where no special custom is known, or where a known one would be inappropriate for the context of this story, it may be possible to expand this clause to “Go and put on special clothes that will make David think you are sad because someone has died.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 16:15</span>: The first half of this verse is literally “I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>). This may suggest that Job will wear the sackcloth permanently, or that he wears it next to his skin. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “I mourn and wear clothes made of sackcloth” avoids expressing either suggestion. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr>, however, translates “The mourning clothes are my second skin,” which implies that Job will wear them all the time. This line may be rendered “I have put mourning clothes on my body,” “I have dressed myself in the clothes of those who mourn for the dead,” or “I wear the rough cloth of those who are in mourning.”","In some passages the wearing of sackcloth is not an act of mourning because of death but rather an expression of sorrow and penitence. See, for example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 58:5; Dan 9:3; Jonah 3:6</span>.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 11:21</span>: The last part of this verse is literally “they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes” (so <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>; see also <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 10:13</span>). Instead of retaining the reference to putting on “sackcloth and ashes,” some translations have said simply “long ago they would have shown to everyone that they were turning from their sins.” However, translators should try to retain these cultural actions in the text, since they were a common aspect of biblical culture."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"בֶּגֶד, אֵבֶל","transliteration":"bigdey ’evel","references":["2 Sam 14:2"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"שַׂק","transliteration":"saq","references":["Gen 37:34","2 Sam 3:31","2 Sam 21:10","1 Kgs 20:31","1 Kgs 20:32","1 Kgs 21:27","1 Kgs 21:27","2 Kgs 6:30","2 Kgs 19:1","2 Kgs 19:2","1 Chr 21:16","Neh 9:1","Esth 4:1","Esth 4:2","Esth 4:3","Esth 4:4","Job 16:15","Ps 30:12","Ps 35:13","Ps 69:12","Isa 3:24","Isa 15:3","Isa 20:2","Isa 22:12","Isa 37:1","Isa 37:2","Isa 50:3","Isa 58:5","Jer 4:8","Jer 6:26","Jer 48:37","Jer 49:3","Lam 2:10","Ezek 7:18","Ezek 27:31","Dan 9:3","Joel 1:8","Joel 1:13","Amos 8:10","Jonah 3:5","Jonah 3:6","Jonah 3:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"σάκκος","transliteration":"sakkos","references":["Matt 11:21","Luke 10:13","Rev 6:12","Rev 11:3","Jdt 4:10","Jdt 4:11","Jdt 4:12","Jdt 4:14","Jdt 8:5","Jdt 9:1","Jdt 10:3","AddEsth 4:1","AddEsth 4:2","AddEsth 4:3","AddEsth 4:4","Bar 4:20","1 Macc 2:14","1 Macc 3:47","2 Macc 3:19","2 Macc 10:25"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Latin","lemma":"saccus","transliteration":"","references":["3 Macc 16:2"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["2 Sam 14:2","Gen 37:34","2 Sam 3:31","2 Sam 21:10","1 Kgs 20:31","1 Kgs 20:32","1 Kgs 21:27","2 Kgs 6:30","2 Kgs 19:1","2 Kgs 19:2","1 Chr 21:16","Neh 9:1","Esth 4:1","Esth 4:2","Esth 4:3","Esth 4:4","Job 16:15","Ps 30:12","Ps 35:13","Ps 69:12","Isa 3:24","Isa 15:3","Isa 20:2","Isa 22:12","Isa 37:1","Isa 37:2","Isa 50:3","Isa 58:5","Jer 4:8","Jer 6:26","Jer 48:37","Jer 49:3","Lam 2:10","Ezek 7:18","Ezek 27:31","Dan 9:3","Joel 1:8","Joel 1:13","Amos 8:10","Jonah 3:5","Jonah 3:6","Jonah 3:8","Matt 11:21","Luke 10:13","Rev 6:12","Rev 11:3","Jdt 4:10","Jdt 4:11","Jdt 4:12","Jdt 4:14","Jdt 8:5","Jdt 9:1","Jdt 10:3","AddEsth 4:1","AddEsth 4:2","AddEsth 4:3","AddEsth 4:4","Bar 4:20","1 Macc 2:14","1 Macc 3:47","2 Macc 3:19","2 Macc 10:25","3 Macc 16:2"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"4.9","book":"realia","title":"Lots","depth":1,"indexItems":[{"target":"REALIA:4.9.1","label":"4.9.1 Urim and Thummim","text":"4.9.1 Urim and Thummim"}],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"גּוֹרָל","transliteration":"goral","references":["Lev 16:8","Lev 16:8","Lev 16:8","Lev 16:9","Lev 16:10","Num 26:55","Num 26:56","Num 33:54","Num 33:54","Num 34:13","Num 36:2","Num 36:3","Josh 14:2","Josh 15:1","Josh 16:1","Josh 17:1","Josh 17:14","Josh 17:17","Josh 18:6","Josh 18:8","Josh 18:10","Josh 18:11","Josh 18:11","Josh 19:1","Josh 19:10","Josh 19:17","Josh 19:24","Josh 19:32","Josh 19:40","Josh 19:51","Josh 21:4","Josh 21:4","Josh 21:5","Josh 21:6","Josh 21:8","Josh 21:10","Josh 21:20","Josh 21:40","Judg 1:3","Judg 1:3","Judg 20:9","1 Chr 6:39","1 Chr 6:46","1 Chr 6:48","1 Chr 6:50","1 Chr 24:5","1 Chr 24:7","1 Chr 24:31","1 Chr 25:8","1 Chr 25:9","1 Chr 26:13","1 Chr 26:14","1 Chr 26:14","1 Chr 26:14","Neh 10:35","Neh 11:1","Esth 3:7","Esth 9:24","Ps 16:5","Ps 22:19","Ps 125:3","Prov 1:14","Prov 16:33","Prov 18:18","Isa 17:14","Isa 34:17","Isa 57:6","Jer 13:25","Ezek 24:6","Dan 12:13","Joel 4:3","Obad 1:11","Jonah 1:7","Jonah 1:7","Jonah 1:7","Mic 2:5","Nah 3:10"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"κλῆρος","transliteration":"klēros","references":["Matt 27:35","Mark 15:24","Luke 23:34","John 19:24","Acts 1:26","Acts 1:26","Acts 8:21","AddEsth 3:7","AddEsth 3:7","Sir 14:15","Sir 25:19","Sir 37:8"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"","transliteration":"lagchanō (verb)","references":["Luke 1:9","John 19:24"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description and usage","heading":"Description and usage:","headingHtml":"Description and usage:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\" alt=\"WEB-0471_pottery_shard_lots.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>Lots were specially marked pebbles, pieces of pottery or sticks used in making decisions.

One form was simply a shallow dish filled with oil with a wick floating in it. Another kind of lamp was about the same size but closed, making it easier to carry without spilling the oil.

It is possible to say “lantern” or “light.” Another good cultural equivalent could be the candle, which works on the same principle as the oil lamp, only with solid fuel rather than oil. Candles were known in the ancient world, although they are not mentioned in the Bible.","As an object whose purpose is to give light, the lamp is sometimes used figuratively in Scripture. All the occurrences of the Hebrew word <em>nir</em> and the Greek word <em>lucerna</em> are figurative. The Hebrew word <em>ner</em> is used figuratively of Israel’s king (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 21:17</span>), God or some something about him, such as his protection, guidance, blessing or word (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 22:29</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:29</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 119:105</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 6:23</span>), life or death as the extinguishing of life (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 18:6</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 21:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 132:17</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 13:9</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 20:20</span>; <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 24:20</span>), the spirit of man (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 20:27</span>), peace or normalcy (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 25:10</span>), and thoroughness (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 1:12</span>).

An example is <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 119:105</span>, which <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr> renders “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.”","While translators will usually agree that a particular passage is figurative, they may not always agree concerning the exact nature of the figure; for example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> do not agree about the meaning of the lamp imagery in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 29:3</span>.

In Old Testament times the normal mill was relatively small and operated by hand. The grain was placed on the stationary bottom stone, and the top stone was pressed down on top of the grain and scraped back and forth to grind the grain into flour. The work of grinding was normally done by women in the early hours of the morning before sunrise. It was hard work and took a lot of time. It is estimated that to produce enough flour to make bread for a family of five, a woman would have needed to grind for over three hours each day.

Some of these mills were relatively small and operated by hand. Others, however, were quite large, and animals were used to rotate the upper stone.","In many parts of the world, grain is ground in one way or another. Quite frequently mills are of the same general structure as those used in ancient times, in which two relatively large, flat stones were placed one on top of the other, and the grain was ground between the two stones.

The choice of an equivalent for these terms relating to “outer garment” will depend largely upon the specific context and the usage in each receptor language. The most common equivalent is usually a term meaning “coat.” In some passages the long robe is culturally significant as an indication of high social status and dignified occupation or activity.","Some Bible passages refer to people tearing their clothes. This was done as an act of grief (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:34; Josh 7:6; 2 Sam 1:11; 2 Sam 3:31; 2 Sam 13:31; 2 Kgs 5:7; Ezra 9:3; Ezra 9:5; Esth 4:1; Job 1:20; Job 2:12</span>). Translators may expand the expression for tearing clothes; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 1:20</span> a <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> has “Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief,” where the addition of “in grief” makes clear the purpose of the gesture. It is also possible to translate the meaning of the gesture only; for example, “Job stood up full of grief” or “Job got to his feet, his heart broken.” Where there is a common local custom used to display grief, it may be helpful to keep the biblical custom in the text and to compare it to the local custom in a note; for example, the note may read “This is equivalent to the practice of painting the face to show that the person is in mourning.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ruth 3:15</span>: The Hebrew word <em>mitpachath</em> would normally be expected to mean a kind of “veil” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>; compare <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span>). In this context, however, it is clear that a veil of thin material would not have been strong enough to carry the weight of the barley. Older translations understood it to be a kind of “mantle” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>), while modern translations prefer something like “cloak” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Others look for a more modern equivalent, such as “cape” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>) or “shawl” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJPSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>).","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span>: Sheffer suggests translating the Hebrew word <em>machalatsoth</em> (plural of <em>machalatsah</em>) in this verse as “loincloths.” It is probably better to say “cloaks” or “shawls.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Tim 2:9</span>: The Greek word <em>himatismos</em> in this verse is the general word for garments of any kind, but since women are being referred to, then the word “dresses” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>) will fit this context if “dresses” are the natural wear in a translator’s culture. However, in cultures where women wear some other type of clothing, translators should use a more general word, as the Greek

The exact nature of these loincloths is not known, so it may be best to use a general term like “coverings,” or to render the last half of this verse as “and they put leaves together to cover their private parts.” One translation expresses the whole sentence as “So they-two sewed together fig leaves and put them on like a skirt to hide their bare skin.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אֵזוֹר","transliteration":"’ezor","references":["Job 12:18"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֲגוֹרָה","transliteration":"chagorah","references":["Gen 3:7"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Job 12:18","Gen 3:7"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"6.5","book":"realia","title":"Animal skin","depth":1,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"עוֹר","transliteration":"‘or","references":["Gen 3:21","Gen 27:16","Exod 22:26","Exod 25:5","Exod 25:5","Exod 26:14","Exod 26:14","Exod 29:14","Exod 34:29","Exod 34:30","Exod 34:35","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:7","Exod 35:23","Exod 35:23","Exod 36:19","Exod 36:19","Exod 39:34","Exod 39:34","Lev 4:11","Lev 7:8","Lev 8:17","Lev 9:11","Lev 11:32","Lev 13:2","Lev 13:2","Lev 13:3","Lev 13:3","Lev 13:4","Lev 13:4","Lev 13:5","Lev 13:6","Lev 13:7","Lev 13:8","Lev 13:10","Lev 13:11","Lev 13:12","Lev 13:12","Lev 13:18","Lev 13:20","Lev 13:21","Lev 13:22","Lev 13:24","Lev 13:25","Lev 13:26","Lev 13:27","Lev 13:28","Lev 13:30","Lev 13:31","Lev 13:32","Lev 13:34","Lev 13:34","Lev 13:35","Lev 13:36","Lev 13:38","Lev 13:39","Lev 13:39","Lev 13:43","Lev 13:48","Lev 13:48","Lev 13:49","Lev 13:49","Lev 13:51","Lev 13:51","Lev 13:52","Lev 13:53","Lev 13:56","Lev 13:57","Lev 13:58","Lev 13:59","Lev 15:17","Lev 16:27","Num 4:6","Num 4:8","Num 4:10","Num 4:11","Num 4:12","Num 4:14","Num 19:5","Num 31:20","2 Kgs 1:8","Job 2:4","Job 2:4","Job 7:5","Job 10:11","Job 18:13","Job 19:20","Job 19:20","Job 19:26","Job 30:30","Job 40:31","Jer 13:23","Lam 3:4","Lam 4:8","Lam 5:10","Ezek 37:6","Ezek 37:8","Mic 3:2","Mic 3:3"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δέρμα","transliteration":"derma","references":["Heb 11:37"],"strongs":[]},{"language":"Greek","lemma":"μηλωτή","transliteration":"mēlōtē","references":["Heb 11:37"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"description","heading":"Description:","headingHtml":"Description:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["<figure class=\"inline-image\" data-id=\"OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\"><img class=\"entry-image\" src=\"./images/OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\" alt=\"OAI-0056_man_wearing_animal_skin.png\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></figure>The hide or skin of an animal could be tanned or untanned.

Camel saddles could be rather elaborate. Sometimes the saddle was an entire large basket or litter in which a person sat. At other times a wooden frame was placed over the camel’s humped back. Over this frame were draped cloths and blankets to cushion the ride and to separate the rider’s legs from the animal’s back. In either of these arrangements, it would not have been difficult for Rachel to find recesses in which to hide a number of small idols. The text does not say that Rachel is sitting on the camel but rather on the camel’s saddle, and it is clear from the context that she is in her tent. When travelers arrived at their camp for the night, it was the custom to remove the saddle and store it in the tent. If it was a wooden frame, then it also served as a place to sit. The wooden frame, shaped to fit over the camel’s back, created a fairly large hollow area as it sat on the floor of the tent.

fermented drink made from the juice of grapes. The grape harvest season began in the land of Israel around the start of July and went on through the summer. The process of extracting the juice (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">1.1.10 Wine press&lt;REALIA:1.1.10&gt;</a>) and fermentation meant that the first wine (the “new wine”) was available in September. Fully fermented wine could be stored for several years, although not as long as is possible today with modern methods of pasteurization and storage. It was common practice to dilute wine with water before drinking it (as much as 50 percent or more). Similarly, wine could also be sweetened with some agent such as honey.","———"]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"translation","heading":"Translation:","headingHtml":"Translation:","subheading":"","languageSets":[],"paragraphs":["Some people have argued that whenever mention is made of Jesus either making or drinking wine, we must assume that this was only unfermented grape juice. There is no real basis for such a conclusion. Only where “new wine” is mentioned can we assume that this is unfermented grape juice or grape juice in the initial stages of fermentation (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.1.1 New wine&lt;REALIA:9.1.1&gt;</a>).","In a number of languages there is no indigenous term for “wine,” and some expression may simply be borrowed from a dominant language. On the other hand, it is sometimes possible to use a descriptive phrase, for example, “fermented fruit juice.” In some languages the equivalent for “wine” is more specifically “palm wine,” which is a wine made from the sap of certain palm trees. Such a term may also have a more generic meaning and may be applicable to any kind of wine. The term used must be an alcoholic drink (not, for example, simply “grape juice”), otherwise references to its intoxicating power will not make sense.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 27:2</span>: The Hebrew text contains the word <em>chemer</em>, meaning “wine.” However, there has probably been a corruption in the final letter of the word, making the proper reading “pleasant” or “delightful.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 9:24; 1 Sam 1:14; 1 Sam 25:37</span>: Some translators render the Hebrew word <em>yayin</em> in these verses as “drunkenness.”","The Hebrew words <em>mezeg</em> and <em>mesek</em> indicate a mixture and probably refer to wine that was diluted with water. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Song 7:3</span> some interpreters and translators understand the meaning to be “spiced wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>). Other translations are “mixed wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NRSV</abbr>) and “blended wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>).","The Hebrew word <em>nesek</em> literally indicates a liquid poured out. In practice, it was the pouring out of wine as an offering to God or other gods. It will sometimes be possible to translate it simply “wine.” Usually, however, something like “drink offering” is to be preferred.","When juice was pressed from grapes, a certain amount of small solids escaped the filtering process. When the juice stood in containers to ferment into wine, these solids (called in English “dregs” or “lees”) sank to the bottom and even aided in the fermentation process, adding to the quality of the wine. They could be filtered out of the wine before it was served. The Hebrew word for these settled solids is <em>shemer</em>. Depending on the context, it can symbolize the quality of the wine (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 25:6</span>), the fact that the wine had not yet been disturbed (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11; Zeph 1:12</span>), or simply what remains at the very bottom of the container (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 75:9</span>). Common-language translations, especially in those places where winemaking is unfamiliar, avoid a literal rendering of <em>shemer</em>. Here are the renderings of <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> for the four appearances of <em>shemer</em>: “to the last drop” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 75:9</span>), “the finest wine” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 25:6</span>), “like wine left to settle undisturbed” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 48:11</span>), and “who are self-satisfied and confident” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Zeph 1:12</span>).","There are a number of passages in the New Testament where translators must be particularly careful in the selection of terms to render “wine”; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eph 5:18</span> a literal translation of “do not get drunk with wine” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) could be interpreted to mean that it is permissible for people to get drunk on other types of intoxicating drinks. Therefore it may be necessary in some languages to render this clause simply as “do not get drunk.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Luke 10:34</span> the second and third clauses are literally “he bandaged his wounds, pouring olive oil and wine over [them].” Here it is important to recognize the medicinal value of oil and wine. In some languages translators have indicated the purpose of such an activity by saying “to cleanse and heal his wounds, he poured wine and oil on them and bandaged them.” It may also be helpful to add a footnote about the antiseptic quality of the wine and the value of the oil in the healing process."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֶמֶר","transliteration":"chemer","references":["Deut 32:14","Isa

of ancient times, often appears in Scripture with the more general meaning of “food.” So the expression “to eat bread” means “to eat a meal” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 37:25; Gen 43:32; Exod 2:20</span>;). Since the bread was not usually cut with a knife but rather broken or torn with the hands, the expression “to break bread” means “to eat” or “to eat a meal” (see <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 16:7; Acts 2:42; Acts 2:46; Acts 20:7</span>).","In many passages the word that indicates one unit of bread is simply “bread,” as, for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 14:17</span>, where the disciples say “All we have here are five loaves [literally ‘five breads’]” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>). In many languages it will be more natural to substitute the word “loaf” for “bread.”","The Hebrew word <em>chalah</em> refers to bread of higher quality since it was made with more expensive flour, called <em>soleth</em> in Hebrew (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.1 Plain flour&lt;REALIA:9.4.1&gt;</a> and <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.2 Fine flour&lt;REALIA:9.4.2&gt;</a>). In some languages it will be possible to make a distinction between this bread and the bread of lower quality.","The Hebrew word <em>kawan</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 7:18</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Jer 44:19</span> refers to bread that was intended not as food but as an offering to a pagan goddess. It may have been shaped like the goddess or marked with her image; translations reflect both possibilities. Similarly, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 13:6; 2 Sam 13:7; 2 Sam 13:8; 2 Sam 13:9; 2 Sam 13:10</span> the Hebrew word <em>lvivah</em> may indicate a special shape (heart-shaped?). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 13:6</span><abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> renders it “special bread” and adds this footnote: “Or ‘heart-shaped bread’ or ‘dumplings.’ ” Translators are advised to follow this example. The point of the story here is that the “special bread” or “special cake” was something better than average, which could help to revive a sick person or at least cheer him up.","The Hebrew word <em>raqiq</em> refers to very thin bread, perhaps even crisp. It appears most often connected to the Hebrew word <em>matsah</em>, which means “unleavened bread” (see <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.4 Unleavened bread&lt;REALIA:9.4.4&gt;</a>). In these passages (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:2; Lev 2:4; Lev 7:12; Num 6:15; Num 6:19; 1 Chr 23:29</span>), it will be best to translate it as a unit together with the word for “unleavened bread” (see the suggestions at <a class=\"cross-ref\" data-target=\"\">9.4.4 Unleavened bread&lt;REALIA:9.4.4&gt;</a>). In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 16:31</span> the Hebrew word <em>tsapichith</em> probably has about the same meaning.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Exod 29:2; Lev 7:12; Lev 8:26</span> (following comments adapted from <em>A Handbook on Leviticus</em> at <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:12</span>, page 95): These verses mention three types of unleavened bread (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> “unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well mixed with oil” in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:12</span>) to accompany animal sacrifices: (1) The first type was a perforated loaf made with flour mixed with oil but without yeast. (2) The second type was a kind of thin, round bread also made without yeast, but on which olive oil was spread. It was similar to biscuits or possibly pancakes. It is mistakenly called “wafers” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">KJV</abbr>. Neither should it be translated “cakes,” which will be misleading in most languages. General terms should be used for these first two types of bread, as long as both terms indicate that they are made without yeast. (3) There is some question about exactly what is meant by the third kind of bread. It was apparently to be similar to the first type, perhaps pierced or perforated, but there is no mention of its being made without yeast and no indication that it was actually baked. This has led some commentators to assume that it was merely a kind of dough made of choice flour and oil. However, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> seems to understand the text to imply both that it was unleavened and that it was baked. Since David shared such loaves with people (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Sam 6:19</span>), it seems best to assume they were baked. And although “unleavened” is not explicitly mentioned for the third type, the contrast with <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 7:13</span> probably indicates that they were made without yeast. Translators will need to find three different words or descriptive phrases for these three types of unleavened bread.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Lev 6:14</span>: The Hebrew word <em>tufin</em>, which is translated “baked” in <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and some other English versions, is difficult and uncertain. A number of other translations and commentaries have understood the word to mean “broken” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NIV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>) or “crumbled” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>). Still others, following the Septuagint, see it as referring to a kind of pastry (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">TOB</abbr>). Translators should probably look for an equivalent to the idea of breaking or crumbling into small pieces. But it may be advisable to add a footnote explaining the uncertainty concerning this term and the different possible translations of it.","The Greek word <em>artos</em> refers to a relatively small and generally round loaf of bread. It was considerably smaller than typical present-day loaves of bread and thus more like “rolls” or “buns.”"]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"חֲבִתִּים","transliteration":"chavitim","references":["1 Chr

Thus they indicate sacks for carrying grain but also handbags carried by women. Often a generic word for a bag made of pliable material such as cloth or leather will suffice. Translators should, of course, avoid a word that specifically indicates a bag made of plastic or other modern synthetic material. The context will usually help the translator choose between specialized terms, where such exist; for example, the Hebrew word <em>charitim</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">2 Kgs 5:23</span> may be rendered “bags” or even “sacks,” while the same word in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 3:22</span> is better translated “purses” or “handbags.”","In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 42:0</span> – <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 44:0</span> the Hebrew word <em>’amtachath</em> indicates a large bag for carrying grain.","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 25:13; Prov 16:11; Mic 6:11</span>: In these verses the Hebrew word <em>kis</em> refers to a bag in which a merchant carried weights. The point of these verses is that business dealings must always be honest, and the fact that the weights were kept in a bag is insignificant. For this reason <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> renders <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Deut 25:13</span> (literally “You shall not have in your bag a stone and a stone, large and small”) as “Do not cheat when you use weights [and measures].” The same approach is taken for the other two references. It is a good model.","In some passages it will be possible to replace the word “purse” with its contents, “money.” The second line of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Prov 16:11</span> is rendered by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> in a similar way, where it has “We will share the booty.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> says “we’ll all share what we steal.”","The Hebrew word <em>tsror</em> may usually be understood as “bundle,” that is, a wrapping prepared for the occasion and not so much a ready container or bag.","The Greek word <em>zōnē</em> in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:9</span> and <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 6:8</span> (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> “belts”) refers to the place where a man usually carried his money. <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr> “pockets” provides a cultural equivalent, and so does <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr> with “purses.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> retains “belts,” while Brc says “money-belts.” Some translators will use a general expression, such as “money carriers” or “things where you carry your money.” However, more often this object is dropped altogether; for example, the last clause of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:9</span> may be rendered “carry no money with you.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 10:10; Mark 6:8; Luke 9:3</span>: In these verses the Greek word <em>pēra</em> is translated many different ways: “beggar’s bag (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>), “beggar’s knapsack” (Brc), “haversack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NJB</abbr>), “pack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">REB</abbr>), “traveling bag” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr>), “knapsack” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Phps</abbr>), “bag” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">AT</abbr>), and “wallet” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">Mft</abbr>). The problem is that this word in the New Testament may refer in general to any sort of bag that a traveler may put his things in or it may have the specialized sense of a bag carried by a beggar. As the survey of translations suggests, there is no agreement among scholars. Therefore translators can say either “bag for travelers” or “bag carried by beggars.” Obviously the apostles were to carry nothing with them when they went out."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Hebrew","lemma":"אַמְתַּחַת","transliteration":"’amtachath","references":["Gen 42:27","Gen 42:28","Gen 43:12","Gen 43:18","Gen 43:21","Gen 43:21","Gen 43:22","Gen

The amount of the large debt would be something like the salaries of 1,000 day laborers for 20 years. However, it would be awkward to try to include this information in the translation itself.

While the ancient hearer may have known that a talent was equal to 6000 denarii, this knowledge cannot be assumed for the modern reader. One effective way to emphasize the difference between the two debts may be to convert the 10,000 talents into denarii and render the last half of verse 24 as “one of them was brought in who owed him 60 million denarii.” This will then contrast with the 100 denarii in verse 28.

It is of primary importance to retain the 5:2:1 ratio. Numerous ways have been found in translation to express the amount given to each servant. Here are a few examples for the first half of verse 15: “he handed five thousand coins to the first servant, two thousand to the second, and one thousand to the third” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr>); “He gave one man ten thousand dollars, another four thousand dollars, and another two thousand dollars” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GW</abbr>); “He gave one servant five bags of gold, another servant two bags of gold, and a third servant one bag of gold” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">NCV</abbr>); and “to one he gave five thousand gold coins, to another he gave two thousand, and to another he gave one thousand” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">GNT</abbr>).","Translations do not agree as to whether the master gave them gold or silver.

However, it may also be used of time, and that meaning is much more satisfactory in the present context. Moreover, the Greek word rendered “span of life” by <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> is more frequently used as a measurement of time than height. Modern translations tend to accept the meaning of a measure of time. If span is used as a measurement of time, the use of the word <em>pēchus</em> to qualify it would mean a brief span, whereas if it is used of a person’s height, it would be a significant amount (about half a meter or 18 inches). <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NAB</abbr> renders the last part of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 6:27</span> as “add a moment to his life-span,” and <abbr class=\"bible-version\">GECL</abbr> has “lengthen his life only by one day.” Other possibilities are “add a little time to his life,” “live a little longer,” and “make his life last even a little longer.” Some translators will indicate a specific amount of time, such as “even one day” or “even one hour.”","<span class=\"scripture-ref\">John 21:8</span>: The distance given here is approximately 100 meters or 100 yards.

Some commentators make the point that, for a city that is 1,500 miles tall, a wall only 72 meters (236 feet) tall is so small that it seems foolish. But it is also pointed out that the wall, in this case, is not for the protection of the city (inasmuch as the gates stay open all the time) but for its demarcation. In any case, the notion of height is preferable to that of thickness. A translation should opt for one or the other; simply to say, as <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> and others say, “a hundred and forty-four cubits” (or, “72 meters” or “236 feet”), without indicating that this is the height, does not qualify as a translation.

Thus, rather than translating “denarius” by some specific amount in a modern currency, it may be equated to a day’s wage. For example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Mark 6:37</span> the literal expression “two hundred denarii” (<abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr>) is sometimes rendered “the equivalent of 200 days’ wages” or even “eight months of a laborer’s wages.” This will be a good solution in most cases with a couple of exceptions: (1) There are some passages where converting to work days will be unwieldy; for example, in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 18:28</span> the debt of the second servant is equivalent to about four months’ wages, which is a figure that people can grasp. However, the debt of the first servant was approximately equivalent to the wages of 1000 men for 20 years. It would be awkward to include this in translation. (2) There are still some cultures in the world where hiring day laborers is unknown because each person or family unit in the village does its own hunting and gathering or even farming. In such cultures “a day’s wage” may have little meaning.","When calculating the number of days’ wages, translators should not forget that, unlike other peoples in the ancient world, Jews did not work one day out of seven. Thus a work week consisted of six work days, and about 25 days made up one work month. The 100 denarii of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Matt 18:28</span> equaled four months’ salary and not three months, as stated in some common-language translations."]}],"languageSets":[{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δηνάριον","transliteration":"dēnarion","references":["Matt 18:28","Matt 20:2","Matt 20:9","Matt 20:10","Matt 20:13","Matt 22:19","Mark 6:37","Mark 12:15","Mark 14:5","Luke 7:41","Luke 10:35","Luke 20:24","John 6:7","John 12:5","Rev 6:6","Rev 6:6"],"strongs":[]}],"references":["Matt 18:28","Matt 20:2","Matt 20:9","Matt 20:10","Matt 20:13","Matt 22:19","Mark 6:37","Mark 12:15","Mark 14:5","Luke 7:41","Luke 10:35","Luke 20:24","John 6:7","John 12:5","Rev 6:6"],"crossRefs":[]},{"key":"11.6.2.6","book":"realia","title":"Drachma","depth":3,"indexItems":[],"sections":[{"type":"entry","contentType":"references","heading":"References:","headingHtml":"References:","subheading":"","languageSets":[{"language":"Greek","lemma":"δραχμή","transliteration":"drachmē","references":["Luke 15:8","Luke 15:8","Luke 15:9","Tob 5:15","2 Macc 4:19","2 Macc 10:20","2 Macc 12:43","1 Esd 3:28"],"strongs":[]}],"paragraphs":[]},{"type":"entry","contentType":"other","heading":"The drachma had the same value as the denarius, that is, a day’s wage.

In English “red,” “tall,” “beautiful,” and “important” are adjectives","<strong>AGENT</strong> is one who does the action in a sentence or clause, regardless of whether the grammatical construction is active or passive. In “John hit Bill” (active) and “Bill was hit by John” (passive), the agent in both cases is “John.”","<strong>ALLUSION</strong> is an indirect or general reference to information or to a text that is already well known. For example, when the Preacher in Ecclesiastes says “and the dust returns to the earth” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Eccl 12:7</span>), this appears to be an allusion to a passage in Genesis (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Gen 3:19</span>).","<strong>AMBIGUITY</strong> refers to words or sentences that have more than one possible meaning in a given context. For example, in the sentence “Mike said that if Joe comes, he will speak to the president,” “he” could refer to Mike or to Joe. Thus this sentence is AMBIGUOUS. Often what is ambiguous in written form is not ambiguous when actually spoken, since intonation and other features of speech help to make the meaning clear. In written discourse, context also helps to indicate which meaning is intended by the author.","<strong>ANACHRONISM (ANACHRONISTIC)</strong> is an expression that is incorrectly used because it is historically or chronologically misplaced. For example, to refer to Jonah buying a ticket for his sea voyage would be an anachronism because it introduces a modern custom into an ancient setting.","The <strong>APOCRYPHA</strong> is a group of books included in the Greek SEPTUAGINT and the Old Testament of the Latin VULGATE but not in the PROTOCANON of the Hebrew canon. See also DEUTEROCANON.","<strong>APPOSITION</strong> is the placing of two expressions together so that they both refer to the same object, event, or concept; for example, “my friend, Mr. Smith.”","<strong>ARAMAIC</strong> is a SEMITIC language that was widely used in Southwest Asia in lands east of the Mediterranean Sea before and during the time of Christ. It is related to HEBREW and in many contexts had replaced Hebrew in use among the Jewish people in the land of Israel at the time of the New Testament.","<strong>ARCHAEOLOGY (ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE)</strong> refers to the study of materials from the past that are dug up or that are found and interpreted to explain life in earlier times. This evidence may lend support to written documents or may give us information to help us understand the text as well as the people of the days when the text was written.","<strong>ARTICLE</strong> is a grammatical class of words, often obligatory, which indicate whether the word to which it is connected is definite or indefinite. In English the DEFINITE ARTICLE is “the,” and the indefinite article is “a” or “an.”","<strong>ASSONANCE</strong> is the repetition of the same or similar vowels in two or more words in close succession; for example, “A good look at the wool” and “Stick the pin in his fingertip.”","<strong>BORROWING</strong> is the process of using a foreign word in another language. For example, “matador” is a Spanish word that has been BORROWED by English speakers for “bullfighter.”","<strong>CLASSIFIER</strong> is a term used with another term (often a proper noun) to indicate to what category the latter belongs. “Town” may serve as a classifier in the phrase “town of Bethlehem,” and “river” as a classifier in “river Jordan.”","<strong>CLAUSE</strong> is a grammatical construction, normally consisting of a subject and a predicate.","<strong>COLLECTIVE</strong> describes a group of things (or persons) considered as a whole, such as “rice” or “crowd.” In English a collective noun is considered to be singular or plural, more or less on the basis of traditional usage; for example, “The crowd is [The people are] becoming angry.”","<strong>COMMON-LANGUAGE TRANSLATION</strong> uses language that is widely understood and accepted by most speakers. In such a translation, substandard speech, dialect peculiarities, and highly literary or technical terms are avoided.","<strong>COMPONENTS</strong> are the parts or elements that go together to form the whole of an object. For example, the components of bread are flour, salt, shortening, yeast, and water. The components of the meaning of a term are the elements of meaning that it contains. For example, some of the components of “boy” are “human,” “male,” and “immature.”","<strong>CONNOTE</strong> means to suggest or imply a meaning that is not explicit in the term used. See EXPLICIT.","<strong>CONSONANTS</strong> are speech sounds that are produced by blocking or restricting the passage of air as it comes from the lungs through the mouth. The written letters representing those sounds are also called consonants; for example, “b,” “d,” “f,” “k,” or “m” in English. Consonants were originally the only spoken sounds written in the Hebrew alphabet. Marks for VOWELS were added later above or below the consonants. See also VOWELS.","<strong>CONTEXT</strong> is that which precedes and/or follows any part of a discourse. For example, the context of a word or phrase in Scripture would be the words and phrases associated with it in the sentence, paragraph, section, and even the entire book in which it occurs. The context of a term often affects its meaning, so that a word does not mean exactly the same thing in one context that it does in another.","<strong>CULTURAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a kind of translation in which certain details from the culture of the source language are changed because they have no meaning or may even carry a wrong meaning for speakers of the receptor language. Cultural equivalent translation should be used only when absolutely necessary for conveying the intended meaning, and it may be important to add an explanatory note. See CULTURE.","<strong>CULTURE (CULTURAL)</strong> is the combination of beliefs, values, social institutions, customs, and material objects (such as tools or ornaments) of any group of people. A culture is passed on from one generation to another but undergoes development or gradual change.","<strong>DEFINITE ARTICLE.</strong> See ARTICLE.","<strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong> is said of a word or phrase that characterizes or describes another term.","<strong>DEUTEROCANON (DEUTEROCANONICAL)</strong> is another term for what is referred to by some as the APOCRYPHA. These are writings that are included in the Greek SEPTUAGINT and the Old Testament of the Latin VULGATE but not in the PROTOCANON of the Hebrew canon.","<strong>DIMINUTIVE</strong> is a word form indicating primarily smallness of size, but also familiarity, endearment, or (in some cases) contempt.","<strong>DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION</strong> refers to a translation that tries to give the intended meaning of the source text in a natural and meaningful way so that it produces a response in today’s reader that is essentially equivalent to that of the original reader. LITERAL translations pay more attention to reproducing the forms found in the source text. For example, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">RSV</abbr> follows the Hebrew wording of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 104:29</span> and says: “they die and return to their dust.” <abbr class=\"bible-version\">CEV</abbr> tries to give a dynamic equivalent translation: “they die and rot.”.","<strong>ELLIPSIS</strong> refers to words or phrases normally omitted in a discourse when the sense is perfectly clear without them. In the following sentence, the words within brackets are elliptical: “If [it is] necessary [for me to do so], I will wait up all night.” What is elliptical in one language may need to be expressed in another.","<strong>EMENDATION (EMEND)</strong> is a correction of a text. It is usually a change made by a scholar through a process of critical editing and not based directly on manuscript evidence.","<strong>EMPHASIS</strong> is the relative importance given to an element in a discourse. Emphasis is conveyed by many different devices, depending on the language; for example, positioning of words, emphatic particles, intensifiers, or ideophones. In “Oh, that you had heeded my commandments!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 48:18</span>, <abbr class=\"bible-version\">NKJV</abbr>), the particle “Oh” marks this statement as emphatic.","<strong>EQUIVALENCE (EQUIVALENT)</strong> is a very close similarity in meaning or in form. See DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION and FORMAL TRANSLATION.","<strong>ETYMOLOGY</strong> is the study of the derivation or history of words. While this can be a helpful study in many ways, it is much more important to know how a word is understood by its users in the actual context of the source language.","<strong>EUPHEMISM</strong> is a mild or indirect term used in the place of another term which is felt to be impolite, distasteful, or vulgar; for example, “to pass away” is a euphemism for “to die.”","<strong>EXAGGERATION</strong> is stating more than the speaker or writer knows to be true. Exaggeration may be used to express humor, IRONY, or sarcasm, or to make a particular point. For example, “Everyone is doing it” can mean “Many people are doing it” (implying “and I want to do it, too”). See also HYPERBOLE.","<strong>EXPANDED TRANSLATION, or EXPANSION,</strong> involves translating a single word or short phrase with a longer one in order to introduce information that will give the reader an understanding that is equivalent functionally to that of the original audience.","<strong>EXPLICIT</strong> refers to meaning that is expressed overtly in the words of a discourse. This is in contrast to IMPLICIT information.","<strong>FIGURE, FIGURE OF SPEECH, or FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION</strong> involves the use of words in other than their LITERAL or ordinary sense in order to bring out some aspect of meaning by comparison or association. For example, when the psalmist says “my cup overflows,” he is not saying his cup is too full. He is rather using a figure of speech to say that he is as content as someone who has been served a generous portion. METAPHORS and SIMILES are common figures of speech.","<strong>FOCUS</strong> is the center of attention in a discourse. It may be marked in a special way such as by word order, a special particle, or repetition.","<strong>FORMAL TRANSLATION</strong> is a type of translation in which many features of the source text, especially the form of the discourse, have been literally reproduced in the translation. This approach often results in an unnatural style in the receptor language, or sometimes in the lack of any meaning at all. See LITERAL.","<strong>FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT</strong> is a type of translation that attempts to convey the same set of communicative functions as that of the original source text. Some important functions of communication are to convey information, to express or evoke emotions, to promote changes in thinking or behavior, or to maintain good interpersonal relations. See also DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION, which has a similar meaning.","<strong>GENERAL, or GENERIC,</strong> refers to a general class or kind of object. It contrasts with PARTICULAR and SPECIFIC. For example, the word “food” is a generic term, while “fruit” is more specific. However, the word “fruit” is a generic term for the more specific word “orange.”","<strong>GENITIVE</strong> refers to a grammatical set of forms occurring in many languages, used primarily to indicate that a noun is the modifier of another noun. The genitive often indicates possession, but it may also indicate measure, origin, characteristic, separation, or source; for example, “people of God,” “man of peace,” “pound of flour,” “child’s toy,” or “Garden of Eden.”","<strong>GLOSSARY</strong> is a list, usually included at the back of a book, explaining or defining unusual words or expressions used in the text.","<strong>GREEK</strong> is the language in which the New Testament was written. It belongs to the Indo-European family of languages and was spoken in the area that is today called Greece. By the time of Christ, Greek was used by many of the people living in the eastern part of the Roman empire, so that early Christians could speak and write to one another in Greek, even though they were born in different countries. By that time the entire Hebrew Old Testament had been translated into Greek, a version referred to as the SEPTUAGINT.","<strong>HEBREW</strong> is the language in which most of the Old Testament was written. It belongs to the SEMITIC family of languages. By the time of Christ many Jewish people no longer used Hebrew as their common language, but spoke ARAMAIC (a language related to Hebrew) or GREEK.","<strong>HYPERBOLE</strong> is a figure of speech that makes use of EXAGGERATION. A deliberate overstatement is made to create a special effect. “He cries night and day” is an example of hyperbole. The statement does not mean that the person cries every moment of the night and day, but that he cries a great deal.","<strong>IDIOM, or IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION,</strong> is a combination of terms whose meanings cannot be understood by adding up the meanings of the parts. “To hang one’s head” is an English idiom. “A drop in the bucket” is an idiom coming from Hebrew (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Isa 40:15</span>). Idiomatic expressions almost always lose their meaning or convey a wrong meaning when translated literally from one language to another.","<strong>IMMEDIATE CONTEXT</strong> refers to the words that immediately precede or follow a discourse or segment of discourse, and which often help one to interpret the meaning of the whole section. For example, <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:2</span> is a passage in the immediate context of <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 1:1</span> and helps to interpret it. See also CONTEXT.","<strong>IMPERATIVE</strong> refers to forms of a verb that indicate commands or requests. In <span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 34:11</span> there are two imperative forms: “Come, you children, listen to me.” Imperatives are often used together with vocative expressions (“you children”). In some languages imperatives occur only in the second person; but in others imperatives also occur in the first and third persons. These are usually expressed in English by the use of “must” or “let”; for example, “They must work harder!” or “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”","<strong>IMPLICIT, or IMPLIED</strong> refers to information which is conveyed by a text, but which is not expressed in words. The speaker assumes that the hearer understands the meaning. Often the meaning is clear from the CONTEXT. For example, when Hannah says in <span class=\"scripture-ref\">1 Sam 2:6</span> “He brings down to Sheol and raises up,” the implied or implicit meaning is “raises up to life.” See EXPLICIT.","<strong>INTERPRETATION</strong> is the process of determining the meaning of a text (or the result of this process), normally in terms of “who said what to whom under what circumstances and with what intent.” A correct interpretation is indispensable before a passage can be translated correctly.","<strong>IRONY</strong> occurs when a person says one thing but means another, often for the purpose of criticism, rebuke, or instruction. When Job says to his friend, “How you have helped him who has no power!” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Job 26:2</span>), he is using irony. He means “You have not helped at all!”","<strong>LITERAL</strong> means the ordinary or primary meaning of a term or expression, in contrast with a FIGURATIVE meaning. A LITERAL TRANSLATION is one that is very close to the forms and word order of the source language; such a translation is frequently unnatural or awkward in the RECEPTOR LANGUAGE.","<strong>LITURGICAL</strong> refers to liturgy, or public worship, including songs, prayers, responses, and so forth. Liturgical language is often traditional or old-fashioned.","<strong>LOAN WORD</strong> is a foreign word that is used in another language. See BORROWING.","<strong>MANUSCRIPTS</strong> are books, documents, or letters written or copied by hand. Thousands of manuscript copies of various Old and New Testament books still exist, but none of the original manuscripts.","<strong>MARGINAL NOTES</strong> are notes that normally occur on the same page as the text and provide purely objective, factual information of the following types: alternative readings (different forms of the source-language text), alternative renderings (different ways of rendering the source-language text), historical data, and cultural details, all of which may be necessary for a satisfactory understanding of the text.","<strong>METAPHOR</strong> is likening one object, event, or state (the “topic”) to another (the “image”) to which it is not directly or closely related in meaning. For example, when a person says “I am a worm,” he is describing his state as being lowly, miserable, or of no value. Biblical metaphors are often difficult to understand because the basis for the comparison is not always stated, as in the line “The LORD is my rock” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 18:2</span>). At other times either the image or the basis of comparison is unfamiliar or used differently in the receptor language. For example, when the psalmist says “He remembers that we are dust” (<span class=\"scripture-ref\">Ps 103:14</span>), he is not referring to the dirt or dust on our bodies. Metaphors are the most commonly used figures of speech and are often so subtle that a speaker or writer is not conscious of the fact that he or she is using figurative language. See SIMILE.","<strong>METONYM</strong> is a figure of speech in which a part of an object is used to indicate the entire object (for example, “one hundred head” means “one hundred cows”), or in which an object stands for another object to which it is related (for example, “the crown” can refer to the king or even the entire royal government)."]}],"languageSets":[],"references":[],"crossRefs":[]}]};
